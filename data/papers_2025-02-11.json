    "abstract": "Understanding the 3D geometry and semantics of driving scenes is critical for developing of safe autonomous vehicles. While 3D occupancy models are typically trained using voxel-based supervision with standard losses (e.g., cross-entropy, Lovasz, dice), these approaches treat voxel predictions independently, neglecting their spatial relationships. In this paper, we propose GaussRender, a plug-and-play 3D-to-2D reprojection loss that enhances voxel-based supervision. Our method projects 3D voxel representations into arbitrary 2D perspectives and leverages Gaussian splatting as an efficient, differentiable rendering proxy of voxels, introducing spatial dependencies across projected elements. This approach improves semantic and geometric consistency, handles occlusions more efficiently, and requires no architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, SSCBench-KITTI360) demonstrate consistent performance gains across various 3D occupancy models (TPVFormer, SurroundOcc, Symphonies), highlighting the robustness and versatility of our framework.

However, these techniques often produce rendered images with issues like blurring and ghosting, which compromise their reliability. These issues become particularly pronounced for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which estimate 3D coordinates at the pixel level. To mitigate the problems associated with unreliable rendered images, we introduce a novel filtering approach, which selectively extracts well-rendered pixels while discarding the inferior ones. This filter simultaneously measures the SCR model's real-time reprojection loss and gradient during training. Building on this filtering technique, we also develop a new strategy to improve scene coordinate regression using sparse inputs, drawing on successful applications of sparse input techniques in novel view synthesis.

We present SC-OmniGS, a novel self-calibrating omnidirectional Gaussian splatting system for fast and accurate omnidirectional radiance field reconstruction using 360-degree images. Rather than converting 360-degree images to cube maps and performing perspective image calibration, we treat 360-degree images as a whole sphere and derive a mathematical framework that enables direct omnidirectional camera pose calibration accompanied by 3D Gaussians optimization. Furthermore, we introduce a differentiable omnidirectional camera model in order to rectify the distortion of real-world data for performance enhancement. Overall, the omnidirectional camera intrinsic model, extrinsic poses, and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized by minimizing weighted spherical photometric loss. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed SC-OmniGS is able to recover a high-quality radiance field from noisy camera poses or even no pose prior in challenging scenarios characterized by wide baselines and non-object-centric configurations. The noticeable performance gain in the real-world dataset captured by consumer-grade omnidirectional cameras verifies the effectiveness of our general omnidirectional camera model in reducing the distortion of 360-degree images.",

However, achieving this using a single imaging modality remains challenging. For instance, traditional RGB cameras suffer from low frame rates, limited exposure times, and narrow baselines. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion approach using Gaussian splatting, which combines RGB, depth, and event cameras to capture and reconstruct deforming scenes at high speeds. The key insight of our method lies in leveraging the complementary strengths of these imaging modalities: RGB cameras capture detailed color information, event cameras record rapid scene changes with microsecond resolution, and depth cameras provide 3D scene geometry. To unify the underlying scene representation across these modalities, we represent the scene using deformable 3D Gaussians. To handle rapid scene movements, we jointly optimize the 3D Gaussian parameters and their temporal deformation fields by integrating data from all three sensor modalities. This fusion enables efficient, high-quality imaging of fast and complex scenes, even under challenging conditions such as low light, narrow baselines, or rapid motion. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets captured with our prototype sensor fusion setup demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving noticeable improvements in both rendering fidelity and structural accuracy.",

While existing approaches predominantly rely on 2D/2.5D techniques treating videos as collections of spatiotemporal pixels, they struggle with complex motions, occlusions, and geometric consistency due to absence of temporal coherence and explicit 3D structure. Drawing inspiration from monocular video as a projection of the dynamic 3D world, we explore representing videos in their intrinsic 3D form through continuous flows of Gaussian primitives in space-time. In this paper, we propose NutWorld, a novel framework that efficiently transforms monocular videos into dynamic 3D Gaussian representations in a single forward pass. At its core, NutWorld introduces a structured spatial-temporal aligned Gaussian (STAG) representation, enabling optimization-free scene modeling with effective depth and flow regularization. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that NutWorld achieves high-fidelity video reconstruction quality while enabling various downstream applications in real-time.

To address these problems, we propose GARAD-SLAM, a real-time 3DGS-based SLAM system tailored for dynamic scenes. In terms of tracking, unlike traditional methods, we directly perform dynamic segmentation on Gaussians and map them back to the front-end to obtain dynamic point labels through a Gaussian pyramid network, achieving precise dynamic removal and robust tracking. For mapping, we impose rendering penalties on dynamically labeled Gaussians, which are updated through the network, to avoid irreversible erroneous removal caused by simple pruning. Our results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive in tracking compared to baseline methods, generating fewer artifacts and higher-quality reconstructions in rendering.",

Specifically, we propose a dynamic sampling and filtering pipeline that adaptively expands the SfM point clouds by leveraging GP-based predictions to infer new candidate points from the input 2D pixels and depth maps. The pipeline utilizes uncertainty estimates to guide the pruning of high-variance predictions, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling the generation of dense point clouds.

    "abstract": "Recent 4D dynamic scene editing methods require editing thousands of 2D images used for dynamic scene synthesis and updating the entire scene with additional training loops, resulting in several hours of processing to edit a single dynamic scene. Therefore, these methods are not scalable with respect to the temporal dimension of the dynamic scene (i.e., the number of timesteps). In this work, we propose an efficient dynamic scene editing method that is more scalable in terms of temporal dimension. To achieve computational efficiency, we leverage a 4D Gaussian representation that models a 4D dynamic scene by combining static 3D Gaussians with a Hexplane-based deformation field, which handles dynamic information. We then perform editing solely on the static 3D Gaussians, which is the minimal but sufficient component required for visual editing. To resolve the misalignment between the edited 3D Gaussians and the deformation field potentially resulting from the editing process, we additionally conducted a refinement stage using a score distillation mechanism. Extensive editing results demonstrate that our method is efficient, reducing editing time by more than half compared to existing methods, while achieving high editing quality that better follows user instructions.",

In this paper, we introduce LayoutDreamer, a framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to facilitate high-quality, physically consistent compositional scene generation guided by text. Specifically, given a text prompt, we convert it into a directed scene graph and adaptively adjust the density and layout of the initial compositional 3D Gaussians. Subsequently, dynamic camera adjustments are made based on the training focal point to ensure entity-level generation quality. Finally, by extracting directed dependencies from the scene graph, we tailor physical and layout energy to ensure both realism and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LayoutDreamer outperforms other compositional scene generation quality and semantic alignment methods.

However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.",

    "abstract": "Recent success in legged robot locomotion is attributed to the integration of reinforcement learning and physical simulators. However, these policies often encounter challenges when deployed in real-world environments due to sim-to-real gaps, as simulators typically fail to replicate visual realism and complex real-world geometry. Moreover, the lack of realistic visual rendering limits the ability of these policies to support high-level tasks requiring RGB-based perception like ego-centric navigation. This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive \"digital twin\" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves RGB-only sim-to-real policy transfer. Additionally, our framework facilitates the rapid adaptation of robot policies with effective exploration capability in complex new environments, highlighting its potential for applications in households and factories.",

    "abstract": "While conventional Transformers generally operate on sequence data, they can be used in conjunction with structure models, typically SE(3)-invariant or equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs), for 3D applications such as protein structure modelling. These hybrids typically involve either (1) preprocessing/tokenizing structural features as input for Transformers or (2) taking Transformer embeddings and processing them within a structural representation. However, there is evidence that Transformers can learn to process structural information on their own, such as the AlphaFold3 structural diffusion model. In this work we show that Transformers can function independently as structure models when passed linear embeddings of coordinates. We first provide a theoretical explanation for how Transformers can learn to filter attention as a 3D Gaussian with learned variance. We then validate this theory using both simulated 3D points and in the context of masked token prediction for proteins. Finally, we show that pre-training protein Transformer encoders with structure improves performance on a downstream task, yielding better performance than custom structural models. Together, this work provides a basis for using standard Transformers as hybrid structure-language models.",

    "abstract": "Research on differentiable scene representations is consistently moving towards more efficient, real-time models. Recently, this has led to the popularization of splatting methods, which eschew the traditional ray-based rendering of radiance fields in favor of rasterization. This has yielded a significant improvement in rendering speeds due to the efficiency of rasterization algorithms and hardware, but has come at a cost: the approximations that make rasterization efficient also make implementation of light transport phenomena like reflection and refraction much more difficult. We propose a novel scene representation which avoids these approximations, but keeps the efficiency and reconstruction quality of splatting by leveraging a decades-old efficient volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm which has been largely overlooked in recent computer vision research. The resulting model, which we name Radiant Foam, achieves rendering speed and quality comparable to Gaussian Splatting, without the constraints of rasterization. Unlike ray traced Gaussian models that use hardware ray tracing acceleration, our method requires no special hardware or APIs beyond the standard features of a programmable GPU.",

To avoid these compromises, we propose a novel framework for compositional scene generation, PhiP-G, which seamlessly integrates generation techniques with layout guidance based on a world model. Leveraging LLM-based agents, PhiP-G analyzes the complex scene description to generate a scene graph, and integrating a multimodal 2D generation agent and a 3D Gaussian generation method for targeted assets creation. For the stage of layout, PhiP-G employs a physical pool with adhesion capabilities and a visual supervision agent, forming a world model for layout prediction and planning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhiP-G significantly enhances the generation quality and physical rationality of the compositional scenes. Notably, PhiP-G attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in CLIP scores, achieves parity with the leading methods in generation quality as measured by the T$^3$Bench, and improves efficiency by 24x.",

To address this issue, we propose a lip-aligned emotional face generator and leverage it to train our EmoTalkingGaussian model. It is able to manipulate facial emotions conditioned on continuous emotion values (i.e., valence and arousal); while retaining synchronization of lip movements with input audio. Additionally, to achieve the accurate lip synchronization for in-the-wild audio, we introduce a self-supervised learning method that leverages a text-to-speech network and a visual-audio synchronization network. We experiment our EmoTalkingGaussian on publicly available videos and have obtained better results than state-of-the-arts in terms of image quality (measured in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), emotion expression (measured in V-RMSE, A-RMSE, V-SA, A-SA, Emotion Accuracy), and lip synchronization (measured in LMD, Sync-E, Sync-C), respectively.",

Our 3D instance segmentation method directly lifts 2D segmentation masks from SAM (alternately FastSAM, etc.), together with features from CLIP and DINOv2, directly fusing them onto 3DGS (or similar Gaussian radiance fields such as 2DGS). Unlike previous approaches, LBG requires no per-scene training, allowing it to operate seamlessly on any existing 3DGS reconstruction. Our approach is not only an order of magnitude faster and simpler than existing approaches; it is also highly modular, enabling 3D semantic segmentation of existing 3DGS fields without requiring a specific parametrization of the 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, our technique achieves superior semantic segmentation for 2D semantic novel view synthesis and 3D asset extraction results while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.

While recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved SLAM with high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering, these systems struggle with accurate depth and surface reconstruction due to multi-view inconsistencies. Simply incorporating SLAM and 3DGS leads to mismatches between the reconstructed frames. In this work, we present Endo-2DTAM, a real-time endoscopic SLAM system with 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) to address these challenges. Endo-2DTAM incorporates a surface normal-aware pipeline, which consists of tracking, mapping, and bundle adjustment modules for geometrically accurate reconstruction. Our robust tracking module combines point-to-point and point-to-plane distance metrics, while the mapping module utilizes normal consistency and depth distortion to enhance surface reconstruction quality. We also introduce a pose-consistent strategy for efficient and geometrically coherent keyframe sampling. Extensive experiments on public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that Endo-2DTAM achieves an RMSE of $1.87\\pm 0.63$ mm for depth reconstruction of surgical scenes while maintaining computationally efficient tracking, high-quality visual appearance, and real-time rendering.

Rather than utilizing the projection of Gaussians, our method employs a ray-tracing mechanism, operating directly on Gaussian primitives represented by confidence ellipses with RGB colors.

Distinct from existing articulated neural rendering techniques, we introduce a differentiable process for spatial transformations based on 3D key points.

Additionally, we propose a real-time shadow simulation method based on per-pixel depth to simulate self-occlusion shadows caused by finger movements. Finally, we embed the hand prior and propose an animatable 3DGS representation of the hand driven solely by 3D key points. We validate the effectiveness of each component of our approach through comprehensive ablation studies.

To recover the physical properties of 3D assets, existing methods typically assume that all materials belong to a specific predefined category (e.g., elasticity). However, such assumptions ignore the complex composition of multiple heterogeneous objects in real scenarios and tend to render less physically plausible animation given a wider range of objects. We propose OmniPhysGS for synthesizing a physics-based 3D dynamic scene composed of more general objects. A key design of OmniPhysGS is treating each 3D asset as a collection of constitutive 3D Gaussians. For each Gaussian, its physical material is represented by an ensemble of 12 physical domain-expert sub-models (rubber, metal, honey, water, etc.), which greatly enhances the flexibility of the proposed model. In the implementation, we define a scene by user-specified prompts and supervise the estimation of material weighting factors via a pretrained video diffusion model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPhysGS achieves more general and realistic physical dynamics across a broader spectrum of materials, including elastic, viscoelastic, plastic, and fluid substances, as well as interactions between different materials. Our method surpasses existing methods by approximately 3% to 16% in metrics of visual quality and text alignment.",

Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

To this end, we propose StructuredField, a novel representation that achieves both a structured geometric representation of the reconstructed object and a high-fidelity rendering reconstruction of the object. We employ structured tetrahedral meshes to represent the reconstructed object. We reparameterize the geometric parameters of the tetrahedral mesh into the geometric shape parameters of a 3D Gaussians, thereby achieving differentiable high-fidelity rendering of the tetrahedral mesh. We propose a novel inversion-free homeomorphism to constrain the optimization of the tetrahedral mesh, which strictly guarantees that the tetrahedral mesh is remains both inversion-free and self-intersection-free during the optimization process and the final result.

In classical computer graphics, materials can be classified as diffuse or specular, interacting with light differently. The standard 3D Gaussian Splatting model struggles to represent view-dependent content, since it cannot differentiate an object within the scene from the light interacting with its specular surfaces, which produce highlights or reflections. In this paper, we propose to extend the 3D Gaussian Splatting model by introducing an additional symmetric matrix to enhance the opacity representation of each 3D Gaussian. This improvement allows certain Gaussians to be suppressed based on the viewer's perspective, resulting in a more accurate representation of view-dependent reflections and specular highlights without compromising the scene's integrity. By allowing the opacity to be view dependent, our enhanced model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Mip-Nerf, Tanks&Temples, Deep Blending, and Nerf-Synthetic datasets without a significant loss in rendering speed, achieving >60FPS, and only incurring a minimal increase in memory used.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach for 3D scene reconstruction using 3D Gaussians. However, neither the centers nor surfaces of the Gaussians are accurately aligned to the object surface, complicating their direct use in point cloud and mesh reconstruction. Additionally, 3DGS typically produces floater artifacts, increasing the number of Gaussians and storage requirements. To address these issues, we present FeatureGS, which incorporates an additional geometric loss term based on an eigenvalue-derived 3D shape feature into the optimization process of 3DGS. The goal is to improve geometric accuracy and enhance properties of planar surfaces with reduced structural entropy in local 3D neighborhoods.We present four alternative formulations for the geometric loss term based on 'planarity' of Gaussians, as well as 'planarity', 'omnivariance', and 'eigenentropy' of Gaussian neighborhoods. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluations on 15 scenes of the DTU benchmark dataset focusing on following key aspects: Geometric accuracy and artifact-reduction, measured by the Chamfer distance, and memory efficiency, evaluated by the total number of Gaussians. Additionally, rendering quality is monitored by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio. FeatureGS achieves a 30 % improvement in geometric accuracy, reduces the number of Gaussians by 90 %, and suppresses floater artifacts, while maintaining comparable photometric rendering quality. The geometric loss with 'planarity' from Gaussians provides the highest geometric accuracy, while 'omnivariance' in Gaussian neighborhoods reduces floater artifacts and number of Gaussians the most. This makes FeatureGS a strong method for geometrically accurate, artifact-reduced and memory-efficient 3D scene reconstruction, enabling the direct use of Gaussian centers for geometric representation.",

It differs from previous 3D generative models by effectively utilizing web-scale 2D priors while maintaining 3D consistency in a unified model. To bootstrap the training, a lightweight reconstruction model is proposed to instantly produce multi-view Gaussian splat grids for scalable dataset curation. In conjunction with the regular diffusion loss on these grids, a 3D rendering loss is introduced to facilitate 3D coherence across arbitrary views. The compatibility with image diffusion models enables seamless adaptions of numerous techniques for image generation to the 3D realm.

However, its reliance on Gaussian kernels for geometry and low-order Spherical Harmonics (SH) for color encoding limits its ability to capture complex geometries and diverse colors. We introduce Deformable Beta Splatting (DBS), a deformable and compact approach that enhances both geometry and color representation. DBS replaces Gaussian kernels with deformable Beta Kernels, which offer bounded support and adaptive frequency control to capture fine geometric details with higher fidelity while achieving better memory efficiency. In addition, we extended the Beta Kernel to color encoding, which facilitates improved representation of diffuse and specular components, yielding superior results compared to SH-based methods. Furthermore, Unlike prior densification techniques that depend on Gaussian properties, we mathematically prove that adjusting regularized opacity alone ensures distribution-preserved Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), independent of the splatting kernel type. Experimental results demonstrate that DBS achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while utilizing only 45% of the parameters and rendering 1.5x faster than 3DGS-based methods. Notably, for the first time, splatting-based methods outperform state-of-the-art Neural Radiance Fields, highlighting the superior performance and efficiency of DBS for real-time radiance field rendering.",

This formulation aligns naturally with standard mesh-based tools, minimizing overhead for downstream applications. To optimize these primitives, we present a differentiable rasterizer that runs efficiently on GPUs, allowing end-to-end gradient-based optimization while maintaining realtime rendering capabilities.

In this paper, we propose GaussianToken: An Effective Image Tokenizer with 2D Gaussian Splatting as a solution. We first represent the encoded samples as multiple flexible featured 2D Gaussians characterized by positions, rotation angles, scaling factors, and feature coefficients. We adopt the standard quantization for the Gaussian features and then concatenate the quantization results with the other intrinsic Gaussian parameters before the corresponding splatting operation and the subsequent decoding module. In general, GaussianToken integrates the local influence of 2D Gaussian distribution into the discrete space and thus enhances the representation capability of the image tokenizer.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that MW-GS delivers state-of-the-art rendering performance, surpassing existing methods.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting offers expressive scene reconstruction, modeling a broad range of visual, geometric, and semantic information. However, efficient real-time map reconstruction with data streamed from multiple robots and devices remains a challenge. To that end, we propose HAMMER, a server-based collaborative Gaussian Splatting method that leverages widely available ROS communication infrastructure to generate 3D, metric-semantic maps from asynchronous robot data-streams with no prior knowledge of initial robot positions and varying on-device pose estimators. HAMMER consists of (i) a frame alignment module that transforms local SLAM poses and image data into a global frame and requires no prior relative pose knowledge, and (ii) an online module for training semantic 3DGS maps from streaming data. HAMMER handles mixed perception modes, adjusts automatically for variations in image pre-processing among different devices, and distills CLIP semantic codes into the 3D scene for open-vocabulary language queries. In our real-world experiments, HAMMER creates higher-fidelity maps (2x) compared to competing baselines and is useful for downstream tasks, such as semantic goal-conditioned navigation (e.g., ``go to the couch\").

In this work, we propose a novel, model-agnostic technique that organizes Gaussians into several hierarchical layers, enabling progressive Level of Detail (LoD) strategy. This method, combined with recent approach of compression of 3DGS, allows a single model to instantly scale across several compression ratios, with minimal to none impact to quality compared to a single non-scalable model and without requiring re-training.

These point clouds are placed in the 3D bounding boxes and initialized into 3D Gaussian Splatting with concept labels, enabling precise identification of concept attributions in 2D projections. Finally, we refine 3D Gaussians via concept-aware interval score matching, guided by concept-aware diffusion. Our experimental results show that MultiDreamer3D not only ensures object presence and preserves the distinct identities of each concept but also successfully handles complex cases such as property change or interaction.

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled precise 3D mapping and scene understanding by rendering photo-realistic images. However, existing 3DGS methods often struggle to accurately reconstruct a 3D map that reflects the actual scale and geometry of the real world, which degrades localization performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS method called Geometry-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GeomGS). This method fully integrates LiDAR data into 3D Gaussian primitives via a probabilistic approach, as opposed to approaches that only use LiDAR as initial points or introduce simple constraints for Gaussian points. To this end, we introduce a Geometric Confidence Score (GCS), which identifies the structural reliability of each Gaussian point. The GCS is optimized simultaneously with Gaussians under probabilistic distance constraints to construct a precise structure. Furthermore, we propose a novel localization method that fully utilizes both the geometric and photometric properties of GeomGS. Our GeomGS demonstrates state-of-the-art geometric and localization performance across several benchmarks, while also improving photometric performance.",

We propose a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method, VIGS SLAM, that utilizes sensor fusion of RGB-D and IMU sensors for large-scale indoor environments. To reduce the computational load of 3DGS-based tracking, we adopt an ICP-based tracking framework that combines IMU preintegration to provide a good initial guess for accurate pose estimation. Our proposed method is the first to propose that Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM can be effectively performed in large-scale environments by integrating IMU sensor measurements.

Existing methods either (1) assume sharp image inputs, failing to address the detail loss introduced by motion blur, or (2) mainly consider blur by camera movements, neglecting the human motion blur which is more common in animatable avatars. Our proposed approach integrates a human movement-based motion blur model into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly modeling human motion trajectories during exposure time, we jointly optimize the trajectories and 3D Gaussians to reconstruct sharp, high-quality human avatars. We employ a pose-dependent fusion mechanism to distinguish moving body regions, optimizing both blurred and sharp areas effectively. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Deblur-Avatar significantly outperforms existing methods in rendering quality and quantitative metrics, producing sharp avatar reconstructions and enabling real-time rendering under challenging motion blur conditions.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a mainstream solution for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. By explicitly encoding a 3D scene using a collection of Gaussian kernels, 3DGS achieves high-quality rendering with superior efficiency. As a learning-based approach, 3DGS training has been dealt with the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which offers at most linear convergence. Consequently, training often requires tens of minutes, even with GPU acceleration. This paper introduces a (near) second-order convergent training algorithm for 3DGS, leveraging its unique properties. Our approach is inspired by two key observations. First, the attributes of a Gaussian kernel contribute independently to the image-space loss, which endorses isolated and local optimization algorithms. We exploit this by splitting the optimization at the level of individual kernel attributes, analytically constructing small-size Newton systems for each parameter group, and efficiently solving these systems on GPU threads. This achieves Newton-like convergence per training image without relying on the global Hessian. Second, kernels exhibit sparse and structured coupling across input images. This property allows us to effectively utilize spatial information to mitigate overshoot during stochastic training. Our method converges an order faster than standard GPU-based 3DGS training, requiring over $10\\times$ fewer iterations while maintaining or surpassing the quality of the compared with the SGD-based 3DGS reconstructions.",

However, its high storage requirements pose significant challenges for practical applications. We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics that are analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- Like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features like edges and contours; While other Gaussians represent broader, smoother regions, that are analogous to broader brush strokes that add volume and depth to a painting. Based on this observation, we propose a novel hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which define scene boundaries, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover smooth regions. Sketch Gaussians are efficiently encoded using parametric models, leveraging their geometric coherence, while Patch Gaussians undergo optimized pruning, retraining, and vector quantization to maintain volumetric consistency and storage efficiency. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrates that this structure-aware approach achieves up to 32.62% improvement in PSNR, 19.12% in SSIM, and 45.41% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes, and correspondingly, for an indoor scene, our model maintains the visual quality with 2.3% of the original model size.",

These methods commonly resort to using exponential family functions, such as the Gaussian function, as reconstruction kernels due to their anisotropic nature, ease of projection, and differentiability in rasterization. However, the field remains restricted to variations within the exponential family, leaving generalized reconstruction kernels largely underexplored, partly due to the lack of easy integrability in 3D to 2D projections. In this light, we show that a class of decaying anisotropic radial basis functions (DARBFs), which are non-negative functions of the Mahalanobis distance, supports splatting by approximating the Gaussian function's closed-form integration advantage. With this fresh perspective, we demonstrate up to 34% faster convergence during training and a 15% reduction in memory consumption across various DARB reconstruction kernels, while maintaining comparable PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS results.

To achieve a compact size, we propose HAC++, which leverages the relationships between unorganized anchors and a structured hash grid, utilizing their mutual information for context modeling. Additionally, HAC++ captures intra-anchor contextual relationships to further enhance compression performance. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to precisely estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Moreover, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Overall, HAC++ achieves a remarkable size reduction of over 100X compared to vanilla 3DGS when averaged on all datasets, while simultaneously improving fidelity. It also delivers more than 20X size reduction compared to Scaffold-GS. Our code is available at https://github.com/YihangChen-ee/HAC-plus.",

However, its rendering quality deteriorates with sparse inphut views, leading to distorted content and reduced details. This limitation hinders its practical application. To address this issue, we propose a sparse-view 3DGS method. Given the inherently ill-posed nature of sparse-view rendering, incorporating prior information is crucial. We propose a semantic regularization technique, using features extracted from the pretrained DINO-ViT model, to ensure multi-view semantic consistency. Additionally, we propose local depth regularization, which constrains depth values to improve generalization on unseen views. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art novel view synthesis approaches, achieving up to 0.4dB improvement in terms of PSNR on the LLFF dataset, with reduced distortion and enhanced visual quality.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently synthesizing novel views from sparse inputs while maintaining accuracy remains a critical challenge in 3D reconstruction. While advanced techniques like radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve rendering quality and impressive efficiency with dense view inputs, they suffer from significant geometric reconstruction errors when applied to sparse input views. Moreover, although recent methods leverage monocular depth estimation to enhance geometric learning, their dependence on single-view estimated depth often leads to view inconsistency issues across different viewpoints. Consequently, this reliance on absolute depth can introduce inaccuracies in geometric information, ultimately compromising the quality of scene reconstruction with Gaussian splats. In this paper, we present RDG-GS, a novel sparse-view 3D rendering framework with Relative Depth Guidance based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. The core innovation lies in utilizing relative depth guidance to refine the Gaussian field, steering it towards view-consistent spatial geometric representations, thereby enabling the reconstruction of accurate geometric structures and capturing intricate textures. First, we devise refined depth priors to rectify the coarse estimated depth and insert global and fine-grained scene information to regular Gaussians. Building on this, to address spatial geometric inaccuracies from absolute depth, we propose relative depth guidance by optimizing the similarity between spatially correlated patches of depth and images. Additionally, we also directly deal with the sparse areas challenging to converge by the adaptive sampling for quick densification. Across extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF360, LLFF, DTU, and Blender, RDG-GS demonstrates state-of-the-art rendering quality and efficiency, making a significant advancement for real-world application.",

However, due to the distinctive properties of cars, such as highly reflective and transparent surface materials, existing methods often struggle to achieve accurate 3D car reconstruction.To address these limitations, we propose Car-GS, a novel approach designed to mitigate the effects of specular highlights and the coupling of RGB and geometry in 3D geometric and shading reconstruction (3DGS). Our method incorporates three key innovations: First, we introduce view-dependent Gaussian primitives to effectively model surface reflections. Second, we identify the limitations of using a shared opacity parameter for both image rendering and geometric attributes when modeling transparent objects. To overcome this, we assign a learnable geometry-specific opacity to each 2D Gaussian primitive, dedicated solely to rendering depth and normals. Third, we observe that reconstruction errors are most prominent when the camera view is nearly orthogonal to glass surfaces. To address this issue, we develop a quality-aware supervision module that adaptively leverages normal priors from a pre-trained large-scale normal model.Experimental results demonstrate that Car-GS achieves precise reconstruction of car surfaces and significantly outperforms prior methods.

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a prominent 3D representation in novel view synthesis, but it still suffers from appearance variations, which are caused by various factors, such as modern camera ISPs, different time of day, weather conditions, and local light changes. These variations can lead to floaters and color distortions in the rendered images/videos. Recent appearance modeling approaches in Gaussian Splatting are either tightly coupled with the rendering process, hindering real-time rendering, or they only account for mild global variations, performing poorly in scenes with local light changes. In this paper, we propose DAVIGS, a method that decouples appearance variations in a plug-and-play and efficient manner. By transforming the rendering results at the image level instead of the Gaussian level, our approach can model appearance variations with minimal optimization time and memory overhead. Furthermore, our method gathers appearance-related information in 3D space to transform the rendered images, thus building 3D consistency across views implicitly. We validate our method on several appearance-variant scenes, and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with minimal training time and memory usage, without compromising rendering speeds. Additionally, it provides performance improvements for different Gaussian Splatting baselines in a plug-and-play manner.",

To address these challenges, we propose GSTAR, a novel method that achieves photo-realistic rendering, accurate surface reconstruction, and reliable 3D tracking for general dynamic scenes with changing topology. Given multi-view captures as input, GSTAR binds Gaussians to mesh faces to represent dynamic objects. For surfaces with consistent topology, GSTAR maintains the mesh topology and tracks the meshes using Gaussians. In regions where topology changes, GSTAR adaptively unbinds Gaussians from the mesh, enabling accurate registration and the generation of new surfaces based on these optimized Gaussians. Additionally, we introduce a surface-based scene flow method that provides robust initialization for tracking between frames. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively tracks and reconstructs dynamic surfaces, enabling a range of applications.

Unlike static 3D Gaussian editing, editing animatable 4D Gaussian avatars presents challenges related to motion occlusion and spatial-temporal inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose the Weighted Alpha Blending Equation (WABE). This function enhances the blending weight of visible Gaussians while suppressing the influence on non-visible Gaussians, effectively handling motion occlusion during editing. Furthermore, to improve editing quality and ensure 4D consistency, we incorporate conditional adversarial learning into the editing process. This strategy helps to refine the edited results and maintain consistency throughout the animation. By integrating these methods, our GaussianAvatar-Editor achieves photorealistic and consistent results in animatable 4D Gaussian editing. We conduct comprehensive experiments across various subjects to validate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques, which demonstrates the superiority of our approach over existing methods.

Integration with the pretrained Vision-Language Model, CLIP, establishes a strong linkage between text descriptions and pose distributions. Enhancement of localization accuracy is achieved by rendering candidate poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, which corrects misaligned samples through visual reasoning.

Many current 3D scene generation methods rely on pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and monocular depth estimators. However, the generated scenes occupy large amounts of storage space and often lack effective regularisation methods, leading to geometric distortions. To this end, we propose BloomScene, a lightweight structured 3D Gaussian splatting for crossmodal scene generation, which creates diverse and high-quality 3D scenes from text or image inputs. Specifically, a crossmodal progressive scene generation framework is proposed to generate coherent scenes utilizing incremental point cloud reconstruction and 3D Gaussian splatting. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical depth prior-based regularization mechanism that utilizes multi-level constraints on depth accuracy and smoothness to enhance the realism and continuity of the generated scenes. Ultimately, we propose a structured context-guided compression mechanism that exploits structured hash grids to model the context of unorganized anchor attributes, which significantly eliminates structural redundancy and reduces storage overhead. Comprehensive experiments across multiple scenes demonstrate the significant potential and advantages of our framework compared with several baselines.",

However, existing vision-only 3D-GS methods often rely on hand-crafted heuristics for point-cloud densification and face challenges in handling occlusions and high GPU memory and computation consumption. LiDAR-Inertial-Visual (LIV) sensor configuration has demonstrated superior performance in localization and dense mapping by leveraging complementary sensing characteristics: rich texture information from cameras, precise geometric measurements from LiDAR, and high-frequency motion data from IMU. Inspired by this, we propose a novel real-time Gaussian-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. Our map system comprises a global Gaussian map and a sliding window of Gaussians, along with an IESKF-based odometry. The global Gaussian map consists of hash-indexed voxels organized in a recursive octree, effectively covering sparse spatial volumes while adapting to different levels of detail and scales. The Gaussian map is initialized through multi-sensor fusion and optimized with photometric gradients. Our system incrementally maintains a sliding window of Gaussians, significantly reducing GPU computation and memory consumption by only optimizing the map within the sliding window. Moreover, we implement a tightly coupled multi-sensor fusion odometry with an iterative error state Kalman filter (IESKF), leveraging real-time updating and rendering of the Gaussian map. Our system represents the first real-time Gaussian-based SLAM framework deployable on resource-constrained embedded systems, demonstrated on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX platform. The framework achieves real-time performance while maintaining robust multi-sensor fusion capabilities. All implementation algorithms, hardware designs, and CAD models will be publicly available.",

The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels at producing highly detailed 3D reconstructions, but these scenes often require specialised renderers for effective visualisation. In contrast, point clouds are a widely used 3D representation and are compatible with most popular 3D processing software, yet converting 3DGS scenes into point clouds is a complex challenge. In this work we introduce 3DGS-to-PC, a flexible and highly customisable framework that is capable of transforming 3DGS scenes into dense, high-accuracy point clouds. We sample points probabilistically from each Gaussian as a 3D density function. We additionally threshold new points using the Mahalanobis distance to the Gaussian centre, preventing extreme outliers. The result is a point cloud that closely represents the shape encoded into the 3D Gaussian scene. Individual Gaussians use spherical harmonics to adapt colours depending on view, and each point may contribute only subtle colour hints to the resulting rendered scene. To avoid spurious or incorrect colours that do not fit with the final point cloud, we recalculate Gaussian colours via a customised image rendering approach, assigning each Gaussian the colour of the pixel to which it contributes most across all views. 3DGS-to-PC also supports mesh generation through Poisson Surface Reconstruction, applied to points sampled from predicted surface Gaussians. This allows coloured meshes to be generated from 3DGS scenes without the need for re-training. This package is highly customisable and capability of simple integration into existing 3DGS pipelines. 3DGS-to-PC provides a powerful tool for converting 3DGS data into point cloud and surface-based formats.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting (GS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are two groundbreaking technologies that have revolutionized the field of Novel View Synthesis (NVS), enabling immersive photorealistic rendering and user experiences by synthesizing multiple viewpoints from a set of images of sparse views. The potential applications of NVS, such as high-quality virtual and augmented reality, detailed 3D modeling, and realistic medical organ imaging, underscore the importance of quality assessment of NVS methods from the perspective of human perception. Although some previous studies have explored subjective quality assessments for NVS technology, they still face several challenges, especially in NVS methods selection, scenario coverage, and evaluation methodology. To address these challenges, we conducted two subjective experiments for the quality assessment of NVS technologies containing both GS-based and NeRF-based methods, focusing on dynamic and real-world scenes. This study covers 360{\\deg}, front-facing, and single-viewpoint videos while providing a richer and greater number of real scenes. Meanwhile, it's the first time to explore the impact of NVS methods in dynamic scenes with moving objects. The two types of subjective experiments help to fully comprehend the influences of different viewing paths from a human perception perspective and pave the way for future development of full-reference and no-reference quality metrics. In addition, we established a comprehensive benchmark of various state-of-the-art objective metrics on the proposed database, highlighting that existing methods still struggle to accurately capture subjective quality. The results give us some insights into the limitations of existing NVS methods and may promote the development of new NVS methods.",

    "abstract": "Achieving high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of traditional methods like Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and monocular SLAM in accurately capturing scene details. While differentiable rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) address some of these challenges, their high computational costs make them unsuitable for real-time applications. Additionally, existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods often focus on photometric consistency, neglecting geometric accuracy and failing to exploit SLAM's dynamic depth and pose updates for scene refinement. We propose a framework integrating dense SLAM with 3DGS for real-time, high-fidelity dense reconstruction. Our approach introduces SLAM-Informed Adaptive Densification, which dynamically updates and densifies the Gaussian model by leveraging dense point clouds from SLAM. Additionally, we incorporate Geometry-Guided Optimization, which combines edge-aware geometric constraints and photometric consistency to jointly optimize the appearance and geometry of the 3DGS scene representation, enabling detailed and accurate SLAM mapping reconstruction. Experiments on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results among monocular systems. Specifically, our method achieves a PSNR of 36.864, SSIM of 0.985, and LPIPS of 0.040 on Replica, representing improvements of 10.7%, 6.4%, and 49.4%, respectively, over the previous SOTA. On TUM-RGBD, our method outperforms the closest baseline by 10.2%, 6.6%, and 34.7% in the same metrics. These results highlight the potential of our framework in bridging the gap between photometric and geometric dense 3D scene representations, paving the way for practical and efficient monocular dense reconstruction.",

First, training a controllable 3D generative network requires a large number of diverse sequences, for which pairs of images and high-quality tracked meshes are not always available. Second, state-of-the-art monocular avatar models struggle to generalize to new views and expressions, lacking a strong prior and often overfitting to a specific viewpoint distribution. Inspired by machine learning models trained solely on synthetic data, we propose a method that learns a prior model from a large dataset of synthetic heads with diverse identities, expressions, and viewpoints. With few input images, SynShot fine-tunes the pretrained synthetic prior to bridge the domain gap, modeling a photorealistic head avatar that generalizes to novel expressions and viewpoints. We model the head avatar using 3D Gaussian splatting and a convolutional encoder-decoder that outputs Gaussian parameters in UV texture space. To account for the different modeling complexities over parts of the head (e.g., skin vs hair), we embed the prior with explicit control for upsampling the number of per-part primitives. Compared to state-of-the-art monocular methods that require thousands of real training images, SynShot significantly improves novel view and expression synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Equipped with the continuous representation capability of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has been successfully employed for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution (ASR). However, the limited receptive field of the linear layers in MLP restricts the representation capability of INR, while it is computationally expensive to query the MLP numerous times to render each pixel. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown its advantages over INR in both visual quality and rendering speed in 3D tasks, which motivates us to explore whether GS can be employed for the ASR task. However, directly applying GS to ASR is exceptionally challenging because the original GS is an optimization-based method through overfitting each single scene, while in ASR we aim to learn a single model that can generalize to different images and scaling factors. We overcome these challenges by developing two novel techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we elaborately design an architecture to predict the corresponding image-conditioned Gaussians of the input low-resolution image in a feed-forward manner. Secondly, we implement an efficient differentiable 2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render super-resolved images by sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted contiguous Gaussians. Via end-to-end training, our optimized network, namely GSASR, can perform ASR for any image and unseen scaling factors. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

The key challenge of this task is learning a robust 3D-aware representation without multi-view or dynamic data, while ensuring consistent texture and geometry across different viewpoints. Although some baseline methods are capable of 3D-aware generation, the quality of the generated images still lags behind state-of-the-art 2D generation approaches, which excel in producing high-quality, detailed images. To address this severe limitation, we propose a novel feed-forward pipeline based on pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting, coined as F3D-Gaus, which can produce more realistic and reliable 3D renderings from monocular inputs. In addition, we introduce a self-supervised cycle-consistent constraint to enforce cross-view consistency in the learned 3D representation. This training strategy naturally allows aggregation of multiple aligned Gaussian primitives and significantly alleviates the interpolation limitations inherent in single-view pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting. Furthermore, we incorporate video model priors to perform geometry-aware refinement, enhancing the generation of fine details in wide-viewpoint scenarios and improving the model's capability to capture intricate 3D textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves high-quality, multi-view consistent 3D-aware generation from monocular datasets, but also significantly improves training and inference efficiency.",

However, these full-reference methods, which compare synthesized views to reference views, may not fully capture the perceptual quality of neurally synthesized scenes (NSS), particularly due to the limited availability of dense reference views. Furthermore, the challenges in acquiring human perceptual labels hinder the creation of extensive labeled datasets, risking model overfitting and reduced generalizability. To address these issues, we propose NVS-SQA, a NSS quality assessment method to learn no-reference quality representations through self-supervision without reliance on human labels. Traditional self-supervised learning predominantly relies on the \"same instance, similar representation\" assumption and extensive datasets. However, given that these conditions do not apply in NSS quality assessment, we employ heuristic cues and quality scores as learning objectives, along with a specialized contrastive pair preparation process to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. The results show that NVS-SQA outperforms 17 no-reference methods by a large margin (i.e., on average 109.5% in SRCC, 98.6% in PLCC, and 91.5% in KRCC over the second best) and even exceeds 16 full-reference methods across all evaluation metrics (i.e., 22.9% in SRCC, 19.1% in PLCC, and 18.6% in KRCC over the second best).",

Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the rendering quality of existing compact Gaussian representations for representative real-world 3D datasets while achieving from 54.6$\\times$ to 96.6$\\times$ compressed storage size and from 2.1$\\times$ to 2.4$\\times$ rendering speed than 3DGS. Even our approach also demonstrates an averaged 2.4$\\times$ higher rendering speed than the state-of-the-art compression method with comparable compression performance.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 2D image generation have achieved remarkable quality,largely driven by the capacity of diffusion models and the availability of large-scale datasets. However, direct 3D generation is still constrained by the scarcity and lower fidelity of 3D datasets. In this paper, we introduce Zero-1-to-G, a novel approach that addresses this problem by enabling direct single-view generation on Gaussian splats using pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our key insight is that Gaussian splats, a 3D representation, can be decomposed into multi-view images encoding different attributes. This reframes the challenging task of direct 3D generation within a 2D diffusion framework, allowing us to leverage the rich priors of pretrained 2D diffusion models. To incorporate 3D awareness, we introduce cross-view and cross-attribute attention layers, which capture complex correlations and enforce 3D consistency across generated splats. This makes Zero-1-to-G the first direct image-to-3D generative model to effectively utilize pretrained 2D diffusion priors, enabling efficient training and improved generalization to unseen objects. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate superior performance in 3D object generation, offering a new approach to high-quality 3D generation.",

Notably, some methods perform well for RGB-D cameras but suffer significant degradation in rendering quality for monocular cameras. In this paper, we present Scaffold-SLAM, which delivers simultaneous localization and high-quality photorealistic mapping across monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras. We introduce two key innovations to achieve this state-of-the-art visual quality. First, we propose Appearance-from-Motion embedding, enabling 3D Gaussians to better model image appearance variations across different camera poses. Second, we introduce a frequency regularization pyramid to guide the distribution of Gaussians, allowing the model to effectively capture finer details in the scene. Extensive experiments on monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets demonstrate that Scaffold-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in photorealistic mapping quality, e.g., PSNR is 16.76% higher in the TUM RGB-D datasets for monocular cameras.",

Apart from novel view synthesis, it has also been extended to the area of multi-view reconstruction. The latest methods facilitate complete, detailed surface reconstruction while ensuring fast training speed. However, these methods still require dense input views, and their output quality significantly degrades with sparse views. We observed that the Gaussian primitives tend to overfit the few training views, leading to noisy floaters and incomplete reconstruction surfaces. In this paper, we present an innovative sparse-view reconstruction framework that leverages intra-view depth and multi-view feature consistency to achieve remarkably accurate surface reconstruction. Specifically, we utilize monocular depth ranking information to supervise the consistency of depth distribution within patches and employ a smoothness loss to enhance the continuity of the distribution. To achieve finer surface reconstruction, we optimize the absolute position of depth through multi-view projection features. Extensive experiments on DTU and BlendedMVS demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a speedup of 60x to 200x, achieving swift and fine-grained mesh reconstruction without the need for costly pre-training.",

    "abstract": "In image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), four-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (4D-CBCT) is critical for assessing tumor motion during a patients breathing cycle prior to beam delivery. However, generating 4D-CBCT images with sufficient quality requires significantly more projection images than a standard 3D-CBCT scan, leading to extended scanning times and increased imaging dose to the patient. To address these limitations, there is a strong demand for methods capable of reconstructing high-quality 4D-CBCT images from a 1-minute 3D-CBCT acquisition. The challenge lies in the sparse sampling of projections, which introduces severe streaking artifacts and compromises image quality. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging spatiotemporal Gaussian representation for 4D-CBCT reconstruction from sparse projections, achieving a balance between streak artifact reduction, dynamic motion preservation, and fine detail restoration. Each Gaussian is characterized by its 3D position, covariance, rotation, and density. Two-dimensional X-ray projection images can be rendered from the Gaussian point cloud representation via X-ray rasterization. The properties of each Gaussian were optimized by minimizing the discrepancy between the measured projections and the rendered X-ray projections. A Gaussian deformation network is jointly optimized to deform these Gaussian properties to obtain a 4D Gaussian representation for dynamic CBCT scene modeling. The final 4D-CBCT images are reconstructed by voxelizing the 4D Gaussians, achieving a high-quality representation that preserves both motion dynamics and spatial detail.

We introduce ZDySS, a zero-shot stylization framework for dynamic scenes, allowing our model to generalize to previously unseen style images at inference. Our approach employs Gaussian splatting for scene representation, linking each Gaussian to a learned feature vector that renders a feature map for any given view and timestamp. By applying style transfer on the learned feature vectors instead of the rendered feature map, we enhance spatio-temporal consistency across frames. Our method demonstrates superior performance and coherence over state-of-the-art baselines in tests on real-world dynamic scenes, making it a robust solution for practical applications.",

To tackle these issues, we propose MoDecGS, a memory-efficient Gaussian splatting framework designed for reconstructing novel views in challenging scenarios with complex motions. We introduce GlobaltoLocal Motion Decomposition (GLMD) to effectively capture dynamic motions in a coarsetofine manner. This approach leverages Global Canonical Scaffolds (Global CS) and Local Canonical Scaffolds (Local CS), extending static Scaffold representation to dynamic video reconstruction. For Global CS, we propose Global Anchor Deformation (GAD) to efficiently represent global dynamics along complex motions, by directly deforming the implicit Scaffold attributes which are anchor position, offset, and local context features. Next, we finely adjust local motions via the Local Gaussian Deformation (LGD) of Local CS explicitly. Additionally, we introduce Temporal Interval Adjustment (TIA) to automatically control the temporal coverage of each Local CS during training, allowing MoDecGS to find optimal interval assignments based on the specified number of temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MoDecGS achieves an average 70% reduction in model size over stateoftheart methods for dynamic 3D Gaussians from realworld dynamic videos while maintaining or even improving rendering quality.",

    "abstract": "Current novel view synthesis tasks primarily rely on high-quality and clear images. However, in foggy scenes, scattering and attenuation can significantly degrade the reconstruction and rendering quality. Although NeRF-based dehazing reconstruction algorithms have been developed, their use of deep fully connected neural networks and per-ray sampling strategies leads to high computational costs. Moreover, NeRF's implicit representation struggles to recover fine details from hazy scenes. In contrast, recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction by explicitly modeling point clouds into 3D Gaussians. In this paper, we propose leveraging the explicit Gaussian representation to explain the foggy image formation process through a physically accurate forward rendering process. We introduce DehazeGS, a method capable of decomposing and rendering a fog-free background from participating media using only muti-view foggy images as input. We model the transmission within each Gaussian distribution to simulate the formation of fog. During this process, we jointly learn the atmospheric light and scattering coefficient while optimizing the Gaussian representation of the hazy scene. In the inference stage, we eliminate the effects of scattering and attenuation on the Gaussians and directly project them onto a 2D plane to obtain a clear view. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world foggy datasets demonstrate that DehazeGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both rendering quality and computational efficiency. visualizations are available at https://dehazegs.github.io/",

We propose a unified architecture that combines point cloud data and feature planes through a progressive tri-plane structure. Our method utilizes 2D feature planes, enabling continuous spatial representation. To further optimize these representations, we incorporate entropy modeling in the frequency domain, specifically designed for standard video codecs. We also propose channel-wise bit allocation to achieve a better trade-off between bitrate consumption and feature plane representation. Consequently, our model effectively leverages spatial correlations within the feature planes to enhance rate-distortion performance using standard, non-differentiable video codecs.

While reconstructive self-supervised learning frameworks such as MAE learns good semantic abstractions, it is not trained for explicit spatial awareness. Our approach, named Gaussian Masked Autoencoder, or GMAE, aims to learn semantic abstractions and spatial understanding jointly. Like MAE, it reconstructs the image end-to-end in the pixel space, but beyond MAE, it also introduces an intermediate, 3D Gaussian-based representation and renders images via splatting. We show that GMAE can enable various zero-shot learning capabilities of spatial understanding (e.g., figure-ground segmentation, image layering, edge detection, etc.) while preserving the high-level semantics of self-supervised representation quality from MAE. To our knowledge, we are the first to employ Gaussian primitives in an image representation learning framework beyond optimization-based single-scene reconstructions. We believe GMAE will inspire further research in this direction and contribute to developing next-generation techniques for modeling high-fidelity visual data.

    "abstract": "Understanding of bimanual hand-object interaction plays an important role in robotics and virtual reality. However, due to significant occlusions between hands and object as well as the high degree-of-freedom motions, it is challenging to collect and annotate a high-quality, large-scale dataset, which prevents further improvement of bimanual hand-object interaction-related baselines. In this work, we propose a new 3D Gaussian Splatting based data augmentation framework for bimanual hand-object interaction, which is capable of augmenting existing dataset to large-scale photorealistic data with various hand-object pose and viewpoints. First, we use mesh-based 3DGS to model objects and hands, and to deal with the rendering blur problem due to multi-resolution input images used, we design a super-resolution module. Second, we extend the single hand grasping pose optimization module for the bimanual hand object to generate various poses of bimanual hand-object interaction, which can significantly expand the pose distribution of the dataset. Third, we conduct an analysis for the impact of different aspects of the proposed data augmentation on the understanding of the bimanual hand-object interaction. We perform our data augmentation on two benchmarks, H2O and Arctic, and verify that our method can improve the performance of the baselines.",

    "abstract": "4D video control is essential in video generation as it enables the use of sophisticated lens techniques, such as multi-camera shooting and dolly zoom, which are currently unsupported by existing methods. Training a video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly to control 4D content requires expensive multi-view videos. Inspired by Monocular Dynamic novel View Synthesis (MDVS) that optimizes a 4D representation and renders videos according to different 4D elements, such as camera pose and object motion editing, we bring pseudo 4D Gaussian fields to video generation. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that constructs a pseudo 4D Gaussian field with dense 3D point tracking and renders the Gaussian field for all video frames. Then we finetune a pretrained DiT to generate videos following the guidance of the rendered video, dubbed as GS-DiT. To boost the training of the GS-DiT, we also propose an efficient Dense 3D Point Tracking (D3D-PT) method for the pseudo 4D Gaussian field construction. Our D3D-PT outperforms SpatialTracker, the state-of-the-art sparse 3D point tracking method, in accuracy and accelerates the inference speed by two orders of magnitude. During the inference stage, GS-DiT can generate videos with the same dynamic content while adhering to different camera parameters, addressing a significant limitation of current video generation models. GS-DiT demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and extends the 4D controllability of Gaussian splatting to video generation beyond just camera poses. It supports advanced cinematic effects through the manipulation of the Gaussian field and camera intrinsics, making it a powerful tool for creative video production.

EnerVerse seamlessly integrates convolutional and bidirectional attention mechanisms for inner-chunk space modeling, ensuring low-level consistency and continuity.

To further augment robotic capabilities, we introduce the Free Anchor View (FAV) space, which provides flexible perspectives to enhance observation and analysis. The FAV space mitigates motion modeling ambiguity, removes physical constraints in confined environments, and significantly improves the robot's generalization and adaptability across various tasks and settings. To address the prohibitive costs and labor intensity of acquiring multi-camera observations, we present a data engine pipeline that integrates a generative model with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS). This pipeline leverages the generative model's robust generalization capabilities and the spatial constraints provided by 4DGS, enabling an iterative enhancement of data quality and diversity, thus creating a data flywheel effect that effectively narrows the sim-to-real gap.

To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-view Gaussian Splatting method for large-scale scene reconstruction, based on dual-branch fusion. Our method independently reconstructs models from aerial and ground views as two independent branches to establish the baselines of Gaussian distribution, providing reliable priors for cross-view reconstruction during both initialization and densification.

In this work, we introduce a parallel Gaussian splatting method, termed PG-SAG, which fully exploits semantic cues for both partitioning and Gaussian kernel optimization, enabling fine-grained building surface reconstruction of large-scale urban areas without downsampling the original image resolution. First, the Cross-modal model - Language Segment Anything is leveraged to segment building masks. Then, the segmented building regions is grouped into sub-regions according to the visibility check across registered images. The Gaussian kernels for these sub-regions are optimized in parallel with masked pixels. In addition, the normal loss is re-formulated for the detected edges of masks to alleviate the ambiguities in normal vectors on edges. Finally, to improve the optimization of 3D Gaussians, we introduce a gradient-constrained balance-load loss that accounts for the complexity of the corresponding scenes, effectively minimizing the thread waiting time in the pixel-parallel rendering stage as well as the reconstruction lost. Extensive experiments are tested on various urban datasets, the results demonstrated the superior performance of our PG-SAG on building surface reconstruction, compared to several state-of-the-art 3DGS-based methods.

In this paper, we propose PanopticRecon++, an end-to-end method that formulates panoptic reconstruction through a novel cross-attention perspective. This perspective models the relationship between 3D instances (as queries) and the scene's 3D embedding field (as keys) through their attention map. Unlike existing methods that separate the optimization of queries and keys or overlook spatial proximity, PanopticRecon++ introduces learnable 3D Gaussians as instance queries. This formulation injects 3D spatial priors to preserve proximity while maintaining end-to-end optimizability. Moreover, this query formulation facilitates the alignment of 2D open-vocabulary instance IDs across frames by leveraging optimal linear assignment with instance masks rendered from the queries. Additionally, we ensure semantic-instance segmentation consistency by fusing query-based instance segmentation probabilities with semantic probabilities in a novel panoptic head supervised by a panoptic loss. During training, the number of instance query tokens dynamically adapts to match the number of objects. PanopticRecon++ shows competitive performance in terms of 3D and 2D segmentation and reconstruction performance on both simulation and real-world datasets, and demonstrates a user case as a robot simulator.

Building on recent advancements in 3D Gaussian splatting, current methods have seen significant improvements in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. However, two major limitations remain: (1) difficulty in handling irreversible dynamic changes, such as tissue shearing, which are common in surgical scenes; and (2) the lack of hierarchical modeling for surgical scene deformation, which reduces rendering speed. To address these challenges, we introduce EH-SurGS, an efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction algorithm for deformable surgical scenes. We propose a deformation modeling approach that incorporates the life cycle of 3D Gaussians, effectively capturing both regular and irreversible deformations, thus enhancing reconstruction quality. Additionally, we present an adaptive motion hierarchy strategy that distinguishes between static and deformable regions within the surgical scene. This strategy reduces the number of 3D Gaussians passing through the deformation field, thereby improving rendering speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed components. We will open-source our code upon acceptance of the paper.",

Existing dynamic reconstruction methods often rely on per-scene optimization, dense observations across space and time, and strong motion supervision, resulting in lengthy optimization times, limited generalization to novel views or scenes, and degenerated quality caused by noisy pseudo-labels for dynamics. To address these challenges, STORM leverages a data-driven Transformer architecture that directly infers dynamic 3D scene representations--parameterized by 3D Gaussians and their velocities--in a single forward pass. Our key design is to aggregate 3D Gaussians from all frames using self-supervised scene flows, transforming them to the target timestep to enable complete (i.e., \"amodal\") reconstructions from arbitrary viewpoints at any moment in time. As an emergent property, STORM automatically captures dynamic instances and generates high-quality masks using only reconstruction losses. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that STORM achieves precise dynamic scene reconstruction, surpassing state-of-the-art per-scene optimization methods (+4.3 to 6.6 PSNR) and existing feed-forward approaches (+2.1 to 4.7 PSNR) in dynamic regions. STORM reconstructs large-scale outdoor scenes in 200ms, supports real-time rendering, and outperforms competitors in scene flow estimation, improving 3D EPE by 0.422m and Acc5 by 28.02%. Beyond reconstruction, we showcase four additional applications of our model, illustrating the potential of self-supervised learning for broader dynamic scene understanding.",

Reconstruction-based methods create 3D scenes from driving logs and synthesize geometry-consistent driving videos through neural rendering, but their dependence on costly object annotations limits their ability to generalize to in-the-wild driving scenarios. On the other hand, generative models can synthesize action-conditioned driving videos in a more generalizable way but often struggle with maintaining 3D visual consistency. In this paper, we present DreamDrive, a 4D spatial-temporal scene generation approach that combines the merits of generation and reconstruction, to synthesize generalizable 4D driving scenes and dynamic driving videos with 3D consistency. Specifically, we leverage the generative power of video diffusion models to synthesize a sequence of visual references and further elevate them to 4D with a novel hybrid Gaussian representation. Given a driving trajectory, we then render 3D-consistent driving videos via Gaussian splatting. The use of generative priors allows our method to produce high-quality 4D scenes from in-the-wild driving data, while neural rendering ensures 3D-consistent video generation from the 4D scenes. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and street view images demonstrate that DreamDrive can generate controllable and generalizable 4D driving scenes, synthesize novel views of driving videos with high fidelity and 3D consistency, decompose static and dynamic elements in a self-supervised manner, and enhance perception and planning tasks for autonomous driving.",

    "abstract": "Understanding geometric, semantic, and instance information in 3D scenes from sequential video data is essential for applications in robotics and augmented reality. However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting is emerging as a state-of-the-art technique in novel view synthesis, recognized for its impressive balance between visual quality, speed, and rendering efficiency. However, reliance on third-degree spherical harmonics for color representation introduces significant storage demands and computational overhead, resulting in a large memory footprint and slower rendering speed. We introduce SG-Splatting with Spherical Gaussians based color representation, a novel approach to enhance rendering speed and quality in novel view synthesis. Our method first represents view-dependent color using Spherical Gaussians, instead of three degree spherical harmonics, which largely reduces the number of parameters used for color representation, and significantly accelerates the rendering process. We then develop an efficient strategy for organizing multiple Spherical Gaussians, optimizing their arrangement to achieve a balanced and accurate scene representation. To further improve rendering quality, we propose a mixed representation that combines Spherical Gaussians with low-degree spherical harmonics, capturing both high- and low-frequency color information effectively. SG-Splatting also has plug-and-play capability, allowing it to be easily integrated into existing systems. This approach improves computational efficiency and overall visual fidelity, making it a practical solution for real-time applications.",

In this work, we propose \\textbf{OVGaussian}, a generalizable \\textbf{O}pen-\\textbf{V}ocabulary 3D semantic segmentation framework based on the 3D \\textbf{Gaussian} representation. We first construct a large-scale 3D scene dataset based on 3DGS, dubbed \\textbf{SegGaussian}, which provides detailed semantic and instance annotations for both Gaussian points and multi-view images. To promote semantic generalization across scenes, we introduce Generalizable Semantic Rasterization (GSR), which leverages a 3D neural network to learn and predict the semantic property for each 3D Gaussian point, where the semantic property can be rendered as multi-view consistent 2D semantic maps. In the next, we propose a Cross-modal Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that utilizes open-vocabulary annotations of 2D images and 3D Gaussians within SegGaussian to train the 3D neural network capable of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across Gaussian-based 3D scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that OVGaussian significantly outperforms baseline methods, exhibiting robust cross-scene, cross-domain, and novel-view generalization capabilities.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing high-quality 3D models from sparse 2D images has garnered significant attention in computer vision. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained prominence due to its explicit representation with efficient training speed and real-time rendering capabilities. However, existing methods still heavily depend on accurate camera poses for reconstruction. Although some recent approaches attempt to train 3DGS models without the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) preprocessing from monocular video datasets, these methods suffer from prolonged training times, making them impractical for many applications.   In this paper, we present an efficient framework that operates without any depth or matching model. Our approach initially uses SfM to quickly obtain rough camera poses within seconds, and then refines these poses by leveraging the dense representation in 3DGS. This framework effectively addresses the issue of long training times. Additionally, we integrate the densification process with joint refinement and propose a coarse-to-fine frequency-aware densification to reconstruct different levels of details. This approach prevents camera pose estimation from being trapped in local minima or drifting due to high-frequency signals. Our method significantly reduces training time from hours to minutes while achieving more accurate novel view synthesis and camera pose estimation compared to previous methods.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis from captured videos are crucial for enabling immersive experiences required by AR/VR and metaverse applications. However, this task is challenging due to the complexity of unconstrained real-world scenes and their temporal dynamics. In this paper, we frame dynamic scenes as a spatio-temporal 4D volume learning problem, offering a native explicit reformulation with minimal assumptions about motion, which serves as a versatile dynamic scene learning framework. Specifically, we represent a target dynamic scene using a collection of 4D Gaussian primitives with explicit geometry and appearance features, dubbed as 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS). This approach can capture relevant information in space and time by fitting the underlying spatio-temporal volume. Modeling the spacetime as a whole with 4D Gaussians parameterized by anisotropic ellipses that can rotate arbitrarily in space and time, our model can naturally learn view-dependent and time-evolved appearance with 4D spherindrical harmonics. Notably, our 4DGS model is the first solution that supports real-time rendering of high-resolution, photorealistic novel views for complex dynamic scenes. To enhance efficiency, we derive several compact variants that effectively reduce memory footprint and mitigate the risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of 4DGS in terms of visual quality and efficiency across a range of dynamic scene-related tasks (e.g., novel view synthesis, 4D generation, scene understanding) and scenarios (e.g., single object, indoor scenes, driving environments, synthetic and real data).",

    "abstract": "While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis and real-time rendering, the high memory consumption due to the use of millions of Gaussians limits its practicality. To mitigate this issue, improvements have been made by pruning unnecessary Gaussians, either through a hand-crafted criterion or by using learned masks. However, these methods deterministically remove Gaussians based on a snapshot of the pruning moment, leading to sub-optimized reconstruction performance from a long-term perspective. To address this issue, we introduce MaskGaussian, which models Gaussians as probabilistic entities rather than permanently removing them, and utilize them according to their probability of existence. To achieve this, we propose a masked-rasterization technique that enables unused yet probabilistically existing Gaussians to receive gradients, allowing for dynamic assessment of their contribution to the evolving scene and adjustment of their probability of existence. Hence, the importance of Gaussians iteratively changes and the pruned Gaussians are selected diversely. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in achieving better rendering quality with fewer Gaussians than previous pruning methods, pruning over 60% of Gaussians on average with only a 0.02 PSNR decline.

Although some successes have been made, existing methods are either Sparse-View but require accurate camera parameters (i.e., intrinsic and extrinsic), or SfM-free but need densely captured images. To combine the advantages of both methods while addressing their respective weaknesses, we propose Dust to Tower (D2T), an accurate and efficient coarse-to-fine framework to optimize 3DGS and image poses simultaneously from sparse and uncalibrated images. Our key idea is to first construct a coarse model efficiently and subsequently refine it using warped and inpainted images at novel viewpoints. To do this, we first introduce a Coarse Construction Module (CCM) which exploits a fast Multi-View Stereo model to initialize a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and recover initial camera poses. To refine the 3D model at novel viewpoints, we propose a Confidence Aware Depth Alignment (CADA) module to refine the coarse depth maps by aligning their confident parts with estimated depths by a Mono-depth model. Then, a Warped Image-Guided Inpainting (WIGI) module is proposed to warp the training images to novel viewpoints by the refined depth maps, and inpainting is applied to fulfill the ``holes\" in the warped images caused by view-direction changes, providing high-quality supervision to further optimize the 3D model and the camera poses. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the validity of D2T and its design choices, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks of novel view synthesis and pose estimation while keeping high efficiency.

SCI is a cost-effective method that enables the recording of high-dimensional data, such as hyperspectral or temporal information, into a single image using low-cost 2D imaging sensors. To achieve this, a series of specially designed 2D masks are usually employed, reducing storage and transmission requirements and offering potential privacy protection. Inspired by this, we take one step further to recover the encoded 3D scene information leveraging powerful 3D scene representation capabilities of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Specifically, we propose SCINeRF, in which we formulate the physical imaging process of SCI as part of the training of NeRF, allowing us to exploit its impressive performance in capturing complex scene structures. In addition, we further integrate the popular 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework and propose SCISplat to improve 3D scene reconstruction quality and training/rendering speed by explicitly optimizing point clouds into 3D Gaussian representations. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive evaluations using both synthetic data and real data captured by our SCI system. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in terms of image reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis has experienced significant advancements owing to increasingly capable NeRF- and 3DGS-based methods. However, reflective object reconstruction remains challenging, lacking a proper solution to achieve real-time, high-quality rendering while accommodating inter-reflection. To fill this gap, we introduce a Reflective Gaussian splatting (Ref-Gaussian) framework characterized with two components: (I) Physically based deferred rendering that empowers the rendering equation with pixel-level material properties via formulating split-sum approximation; (II) Gaussian-grounded inter-reflection that realizes the desired inter-reflection function within a Gaussian splatting paradigm for the first time. To enhance geometry modeling, we further introduce material-aware normal propagation and an initial per-Gaussian shading stage, along with 2D Gaussian primitives. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that Ref-Gaussian surpasses existing approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and compute efficiency. Further, we show that our method serves as a unified solution for both reflective and non-reflective scenes, going beyond the previous alternatives focusing on only reflective scenes. Also, we illustrate that Ref-Gaussian supports more applications such as relighting and editing.",

Central to our approach is the Editable Gaussian Head (EG-Head) model, which combines a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with texture maps, allowing precise expression control and flexible texture editing for accurate animation while preserving identity. To capture complex non-facial geometries like hair, we use an auxiliary set of 3DGS and tri-plane features.

Compared to the emerging 3D representation technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), the spatially sparse point cloud cannot depict the texture information of 3D objects, resulting in inferior reconstruction capabilities. This limitation constrains the potential of point cloud-based 3D multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we present CLIP-GS, a novel multimodal representation learning framework grounded in 3DGS. We introduce the GS Tokenizer to generate serialized gaussian tokens, which are then processed through transformer layers pre-initialized with weights from point cloud models, resulting in the 3DGS embeddings. CLIP-GS leverages contrastive loss between 3DGS and the visual-text embeddings of CLIP, and we introduce an image voting loss to guide the directionality and convergence of gradient optimization. Furthermore, we develop an efficient way to generate triplets of 3DGS, images, and text, facilitating CLIP-GS in learning unified multimodal representations. Leveraging the well-aligned multimodal representations, CLIP-GS demonstrates versatility and outperforms point cloud-based models on various 3D tasks, including multimodal retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification.",

Moreover, depth estimation based solely on images is often ambiguous, resulting in low-quality 3D models that lead to inaccurate renderings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for high-quality 3DGS modeling that leverages an online multi-view stereo (MVS) approach. Our method estimates MVS depth using sequential frames from a local time window and applies comprehensive depth refinement techniques to filter out outliers, enabling accurate initialization of Gaussians in 3DGS.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Gaussian splatting emerged as a powerful technique in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, boasting high fidelity and rendering speeds. In this paper, we introduce GSAVS, an autonomous vehicle simulator that supports the creation and development of autonomous vehicle models. Every asset within the simulator is a 3D Gaussian splat, including the vehicles and the environment.

To solve this problem, this paper introduces ArtNVG, an innovative 3D stylization framework that efficiently generates stylized 3D scenes by leveraging reference style images. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), ArtNVG achieves rapid optimization and rendering while upholding high reconstruction quality. Our framework realizes high-quality 3D stylization by incorporating two pivotal techniques: Content-Style Separated Control and Attention-based Neighboring-View Alignment. Content-Style Separated Control uses the CSGO model and the Tile ControlNet to decouple the content and style control, reducing risks of information leakage. Concurrently, Attention-based Neighboring-View Alignment ensures consistency of local colors and textures across neighboring views, significantly improving visual quality. Extensive experiments validate that ArtNVG surpasses existing methods, delivering superior results in content preservation, style alignment, and local consistency.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based 3D imaging, in particular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is challenging because of limited availability of 3D training data. Therefore, 2D diffusion models trained on 2D slices are starting to be leveraged for 3D MRI reconstruction. However, as we show in this paper, existing methods pertain to a fixed voxel size, and performance degrades when the voxel size is varied, as it is often the case in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose and study several approaches for resolution-robust 3D MRI reconstruction with 2D diffusion priors. As a result of this investigation, we obtain a simple resolution-robust variational 3D reconstruction approach based on diffusion-guided regularization of randomly sampled 2D slices. This method provides competitive reconstruction quality compared to posterior sampling baselines. Towards resolving the sensitivity to resolution-shifts, we investigate state-of-the-art model-based approaches including Gaussian splatting, neural representations, and infinite-dimensional diffusion models, as well as a simple data-centric approach of training the diffusion model on several resolutions. Our experiments demonstrate that the model-based approaches fail to close the performance gap in 3D MRI. In contrast, the data-centric approach of training the diffusion model on various resolutions effectively provides a resolution-robust method without compromising accuracy.",

To train our system, we develop a dataset of multi-view renderings using synthetic 3D human head as-sets. The diffusion-based multi-view generator is trained exclusively on synthetic head images, while the GS-LRM reconstructor undergoes initial training on Objaverse followed by fine-tuning on synthetic head data. FaceLift excels at preserving identity and maintaining view consistency across views. Despite being trained solely on synthetic data, FaceLift demonstrates remarkable generalization to real-world images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show that FaceLift outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D head reconstruction, highlighting its practical applicability and robust performance on real-world images. In addition to single image reconstruction, FaceLift supports video inputs for 4D novel view synthesis and seamlessly integrates with 2D reanimation techniques to enable 3D facial animation.

GaussianPainter introduces an innovative feed-forward approach to overcome the limitations of time-consuming test-time optimization in 3D Gaussian splatting. Our method addresses a critical challenge in the field: the non-uniqueness problem inherent in the large parameter space of 3D Gaussian splatting. This space, encompassing rotation, anisotropic scales, and spherical harmonic coefficients, introduces the challenge of rendering similar images from substantially different Gaussian fields. As a result, feed-forward networks face instability when attempting to directly predict high-quality Gaussian fields, struggling to converge on consistent parameters for a given output. To address this issue, we propose to estimate a surface normal for each point to determine its Gaussian rotation. This strategy enables the network to effectively predict the remaining Gaussian parameters in the constrained space. We further enhance our approach with an appearance injection module, incorporating reference image appearance into Gaussian fields via a multiscale triplane representation.

    "abstract": "Applying Gaussian Splatting to perception tasks for 3D scene understanding is becoming increasingly popular. Most existing works primarily focus on rendering 2D feature maps from novel viewpoints, which leads to an imprecise 3D language field with outlier languages, ultimately failing to align objects in 3D space. By utilizing masked images for feature extraction, these approaches also lack essential contextual information, leading to inaccurate feature representation. To this end, we propose a Language-Embedded Surface Field (LangSurf), which accurately aligns the 3D language fields with the surface of objects, facilitating precise 2D and 3D segmentation with text query, widely expanding the downstream tasks such as removal and editing. The core of LangSurf is a joint training strategy that flattens the language Gaussian on the object surfaces using geometry supervision and contrastive losses to assign accurate language features to the Gaussians of objects. In addition, we also introduce the Hierarchical-Context Awareness Module to extract features at the image level for contextual information then perform hierarchical mask pooling using masks segmented by SAM to obtain fine-grained language features in different hierarchies. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary 2D and 3D semantic segmentation demonstrate that LangSurf outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method LangSplat by a large margin. As shown in Fig. 1, our method is capable of segmenting objects in 3D space, thus boosting the effectiveness of our approach in instance recognition, removal, and editing, which is also supported by comprehensive experiments. \\url{https://langsurf.github.io}.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in scene reconstruction. However, most existing GS-based surface reconstruction methods focus on 3D objects or limited scenes. Directly applying these methods to large-scale scene reconstruction will pose challenges such as high memory costs, excessive time consumption, and lack of geometric detail, which makes it difficult to implement in practical applications. To address these issues, we propose a multi-agent collaborative fast 3DGS surface reconstruction framework based on distributed learning for large-scale surface reconstruction. Specifically, we develop local model compression (LMC) and model aggregation schemes (MAS) to achieve high-quality surface representation of large scenes while reducing GPU memory consumption. Extensive experiments on Urban3d, MegaNeRF, and BlendedMVS demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve fast and scalable high-fidelity surface reconstruction and photorealistic rendering.

However, training a 3DGS model remains a time-intensive task, especially in load imbalance scenarios where workload diversity among pixels and Gaussian spheres causes poor renderCUDA kernel performance. We introduce Balanced 3DGS, a Gaussian-wise parallelism rendering with fine-grained tiling approach in 3DGS training process, perfectly solving load-imbalance issues. First, we innovatively introduce the inter-block dynamic workload distribution technique to map workloads to Streaming Multiprocessor(SM) resources within a single GPU dynamically, which constitutes the foundation of load balancing. Second, we are the first to propose the Gaussian-wise parallel rendering technique to significantly reduce workload divergence inside a warp, which serves as a critical component in addressing load imbalance. Based on the above two methods, we further creatively put forward the fine-grained combined load balancing technique to uniformly distribute workload across all SMs, which boosts the forward renderCUDA kernel performance by up to 7.52x. Besides, we present a self-adaptive render kernel selection strategy during the 3DGS training process based on different load-balance situations, which effectively improves training efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Modeling and understanding the 3D world is crucial for various applications, from augmented reality to robotic navigation. Recent advancements based on 3D Gaussian Splatting have integrated semantic information from multi-view images into Gaussian primitives. However, these methods typically require costly per-scene optimization from dense calibrated images, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we consider the new task of generalizable 3D semantic field modeling from sparse, uncalibrated image pairs. Building upon the Splatt3R architecture, we introduce GSemSplat, a framework that learns open-vocabulary semantic representations linked to 3D Gaussians without the need for per-scene optimization, dense image collections or calibration. To ensure effective and reliable learning of semantic features in 3D space, we employ a dual-feature approach that leverages both region-specific and context-aware semantic features as supervision in the 2D space. This allows us to capitalize on their complementary strengths. Experimental results on the ScanNet++ dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach compared to the traditional scene-specific method. We hope our work will inspire more research into generalizable 3D understanding.",

High-quality reconstrution of 3DGS relies on sufficient splats and a reasonable distribution of these splats to fit real geometric surface and texture details, which turns out to be a challenging problem. We present GeoTexDensifier, a novel geometry-texture-aware densification strategy to reconstruct high-quality Gaussian splats which better comply with the geometric structure and texture richness of the scene. Specifically, our GeoTexDensifier framework carries out an auxiliary texture-aware densification method to produce a denser distribution of splats in fully textured areas, while keeping sparsity in low-texture regions to maintain the quality of Gaussian point cloud. Meanwhile, a geometry-aware splitting strategy takes depth and normal priors to guide the splitting sampling and filter out the noisy splats whose initial positions are far from the actual geometric surfaces they aim to fit, under a Validation of Depth Ratio Change checking. With the help of relative monocular depth prior, such geometry-aware validation can effectively reduce the influence of scattered Gaussians to the final rendering quality, especially in regions with weak textures or without sufficient training views. The texture-aware densification and geometry-aware splitting strategies are fully combined to obtain a set of high-quality Gaussian splats. We experiment our GeoTexDensifier framework on various datasets and compare our Novel View Synthesis results to other state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches, with detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing more photorealistic 3DGS models.",

It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.",

Although omnidirectional images are getting more popular since they reduce the computation for image stitching to composite a holistic scene, existing feed-forward models are only designed for perspective images. The unique optical properties of omnidirectional images make it difficult for feature encoders to correctly understand the context of the image and make the Gaussian non-uniform in space, which hinders the image quality synthesized from novel views. We propose OmniSplat, a pioneering work for fast feed-forward 3DGS generation from a few omnidirectional images. We introduce Yin-Yang grid and decompose images based on it to reduce the domain gap between omnidirectional and perspective images. The Yin-Yang grid can use the existing CNN structure as it is, but its quasi-uniform characteristic allows the decomposed image to be similar to a perspective image, so it can exploit the strong prior knowledge of the learned feed-forward network. OmniSplat demonstrates higher reconstruction accuracy than existing feed-forward networks trained on perspective images. Furthermore, we enhance the segmentation consistency between omnidirectional images by leveraging attention from the encoder of OmniSplat, providing fast and clean 3DGS editing results.",

Our trained policies exhibit zero-shot sim-to-real transfer with robust real-world performance using only on-board perception and computation. Our simulator, called FiGS, couples a computationally simple drone dynamics model with a high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting scene reconstruction. FiGS can quickly simulate drone flights producing photorealistic images at up to 130 fps. We use FiGS to collect 100k-300k observation-action pairs from an expert MPC with privileged state and dynamics information, randomized over dynamics parameters and spatial disturbances. We then distill this expert MPC into an end-to-end visuomotor policy with a lightweight neural architecture, called SV-Net. SV-Net processes color image, optical flow and IMU data streams into low-level body rate and thrust commands at 20Hz onboard a drone. Crucially, SV-Net includes a Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA) module that adapts at runtime to variations in drone dynamics. In a campaign of 105 hardware experiments, we show SOUS VIDE policies to be robust to 30% mass variations, 40 m/s wind gusts, 60% changes in ambient brightness, shifting or removing objects from the scene, and people moving aggressively through the drone's visual field.

In this study, we propose CoCoGaussian, a Circle of Confusion-aware Gaussian Splatting that enables precise 3D scene representation using only defocused images. CoCoGaussian addresses the challenge of defocus blur by modeling the Circle of Confusion (CoC) through a physically grounded approach based on the principles of photographic defocus. Exploiting 3D Gaussians, we compute the CoC diameter from depth and learnable aperture information, generating multiple Gaussians to precisely capture the CoC shape. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable scaling factor to enhance robustness and provide more flexibility in handling unreliable depth in scenes with reflective or refractive surfaces. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CoCoGaussian achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.",

With our framework, users capture a video of an environment, which we turn into a high-quality and explicit appearance model thanks to 3D Gaussian Splatting. Users then select regions of interest guided by semantically-aware features. To create a generative primitive, we adapt Generative Cellular Automata to single-exemplar training and controllable generation. We decouple the generative task from the appearance model by operating on sparse voxels and we recover a high-quality output with a subsequent sparse patch consistency step. Each primitive can be trained within 10 minutes and used to author new scenes interactively in a fully compositional manner. We showcase interactive sessions where various primitives are extracted from real-world scenes and controlled to create 3D assets and scenes in a few minutes.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) has gained popularity due to its faster rendering speed and high-quality novel view synthesis. Some researchers have explored using 3D GS for reconstructing driving scenes. However, these methods often rely on various data types, such as depth maps, 3D boxes, and trajectories of moving objects. Additionally, the lack of annotations for synthesized images limits their direct application in downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose EGSRAL, a 3D GS-based method that relies solely on training images without extra annotations. EGSRAL enhances 3D GS's capability to model both dynamic objects and static backgrounds and introduces a novel adaptor for auto labeling, generating corresponding annotations based on existing annotations. We also propose a grouping strategy for vanilla 3D GS to address perspective issues in rendering large-scale, complex scenes. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets without any extra annotation. For example, the PSNR metric reaches 29.04 on the nuScenes dataset. Moreover, our automated labeling can significantly improve the performance of 2D/3D detection tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/jiangxb98/EGSRAL.",

    "abstract": "Photorealistic 3D scene reconstruction plays an important role in autonomous driving, enabling the generation of novel data from existing datasets to simulate safety-critical scenarios and expand training data without additional acquisition costs. Gaussian Splatting (GS) facilitates real-time, photorealistic rendering with an explicit 3D Gaussian representation of the scene, providing faster processing and more intuitive scene editing than the implicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). While extensive GS research has yielded promising advancements in autonomous driving applications, they overlook two critical aspects: First, existing methods mainly focus on low-speed and feature-rich urban scenes and ignore the fact that highway scenarios play a significant role in autonomous driving. Second, while LiDARs are commonplace in autonomous driving platforms, existing methods learn primarily from images and use LiDAR only for initial estimates or without precise sensor modeling, thus missing out on leveraging the rich depth information LiDAR offers and limiting the ability to synthesize LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a novel GS method for dynamic scene synthesis and editing with improved scene reconstruction through LiDAR supervision and support for LiDAR rendering. Unlike prior works that are tested mostly on urban datasets, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to focus on the more challenging and highly relevant highway scenes for autonomous driving, with sparse sensor views and monotone backgrounds.

    "abstract": "Gaussian splatting has achieved impressive improvements for both novel-view synthesis and surface reconstruction from multi-view images. However, current methods still struggle to reconstruct high-quality surfaces from only sparse view input images using Gaussian splatting. In this paper, we propose a novel method called SolidGS to address this problem. We observed that the reconstructed geometry can be severely inconsistent across multi-views, due to the property of Gaussian function in geometry rendering. This motivates us to consolidate all Gaussians by adopting a more solid kernel function, which effectively improves the surface reconstruction quality. With the additional help of geometrical regularization and monocular normal estimation, our method achieves superior performance on the sparse view surface reconstruction than all the Gaussian splatting methods and neural field methods on the widely used DTU, Tanks-and-Temples, and LLFF datasets.",

While previous methods require a desktop GPU for real-time inference of a single avatar, we aim to squeeze multiple Gaussian avatars onto a portable virtual reality headset with real-time drivable inference. We begin by training a previous work, Animatable Gaussians, on a high quality dataset captured with 512 cameras. The Gaussians are animated by controlling base set of Gaussians with linear blend skinning (LBS) motion and then further adjusting the Gaussians with a neural network decoder to correct their appearance. When deploying the model on a Meta Quest 3 VR headset, we find two major computational bottlenecks: the decoder and the rendering. To accelerate the decoder, we train the Gaussians in UV-space instead of pixel-space, and we distill the decoder to a single neural network layer. Further, we discover that neighborhoods of Gaussians can share a single corrective from the decoder, which provides an additional speedup. To accelerate the rendering, we develop a custom pipeline in Vulkan that runs on the mobile GPU. Putting it all together, we run 3 Gaussian avatars concurrently at 72 FPS on a VR headset.

    "abstract": "A world model provides an agent with a representation of its environment, enabling it to predict the causal consequences of its actions. Current world models typically cannot directly and explicitly imitate the actual environment in front of a robot, often resulting in unrealistic behaviors and hallucinations that make them unsuitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm for constructing world models that are explicit representations of the real world and its dynamics. By integrating cutting-edge advances in real-time photorealism with Gaussian Splatting and physics simulators, we propose the first compositional manipulation world model, which we call DreMa. DreMa replicates the observed world and its dynamics, allowing it to imagine novel configurations of objects and predict the future consequences of robot actions. We leverage this capability to generate new data for imitation learning by applying equivariant transformations to a small set of demonstrations. Our evaluations across various settings demonstrate significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness by incrementing actions and object distributions, reducing the data needed to learn a policy and improving the generalization of the agents. As a highlight, we show that a real Franka Emika Panda robot, powered by DreMa's imagination, can successfully learn novel physical tasks from just a single example per task variation (one-shot policy learning).

Previous weakly-supervised NeRF methods balance efficiency and accuracy, with mIoU varying by 5-10 points due to sampling count along camera rays. Recently, real-time Gaussian splatting has gained widespread popularity in 3D reconstruction, and the occupancy prediction task can also be viewed as a reconstruction task. Consequently, we propose GSRender, which naturally employs 3D Gaussian Splatting for occupancy prediction, simplifying the sampling process. In addition, the limitations of 2D supervision result in duplicate predictions along the same camera ray. We implemented the Ray Compensation (RC) module, which mitigates this issue by compensating for features from adjacent frames. Finally, we redesigned the loss to eliminate the impact of dynamic objects from adjacent frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves SOTA (state-of-the-art) results in RayIoU (+6.0), while narrowing the gap with 3D supervision methods. Our code will be released soon.",

However, directly applying 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a refinement step following these models presents challenges. We hypothesize that the excessive positional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in Gaussians induce geometry distortion, fitting color patterns at the cost of structural fidelity. To address this, we propose reprojection-based DoF separation, a method distinguishing positional DoFs in terms of uncertainty: image-plane-parallel DoFs and ray-aligned DoF. To independently manage each DoF, we introduce a reprojection process along with tailored constraints for each DoF. Through experiments across various datasets, we confirm that separating the positional DoFs of Gaussians and applying targeted constraints effectively suppresses geometric artifacts, producing reconstruction results that are both visually and geometrically plausible.",

    "abstract": "Rendering photorealistic head avatars from arbitrary viewpoints is crucial for various applications like virtual reality. Although previous methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can achieve impressive results, they lack fidelity and efficiency. Recent methods using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved rendering quality and real-time performance but still require significant storage overhead. In this paper, we introduce a method called GraphAvatar that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to generate 3D Gaussians for the head avatar. Specifically, GraphAvatar trains a geometric GNN and an appearance GNN to generate the attributes of the 3D Gaussians from the tracked mesh. Therefore, our method can store the GNN models instead of the 3D Gaussians, significantly reducing the storage overhead to just 10MB. To reduce the impact of face-tracking errors, we also present a novel graph-guided optimization module to refine face-tracking parameters during training. Finally, we introduce a 3D-aware enhancer for post-processing to enhance the rendering quality. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of GraphAvatar, surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity and storage consumption. The ablation study sheds light on the trade-offs between rendering quality and model size. The code will be released at: https://github.com/ucwxb/GraphAvatar",

In this paper, we propose GAGS, a framework that distills 2D CLIP features into 3D Gaussian splatting, enabling open-vocabulary queries for renderings on arbitrary viewpoints. The main challenge of distilling 2D features for 3D fields lies in the multiview inconsistency of extracted 2D features, which provides unstable supervision for the 3D feature field. GAGS addresses this challenge with two novel strategies. First, GAGS associates the prompt point density of SAM with the camera distances, which significantly improves the multiview consistency of segmentation results. Second, GAGS further decodes a granularity factor to guide the distillation process and this granularity factor can be learned in a unsupervised manner to only select the multiview consistent 2D features in the distillation process. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate significant performance and stability improvements of GAGS in visual grounding and semantic segmentation, with an inference speed 2$\\times$ faster than baseline methods.

However, the noisy and sparse nature of the returned scan data proves to be a challenging obstacle for existing point cloud matching based solutions, especially those originally intended for more accurate sensors such as LiDAR. Inspired by visual odometry research around 3D Gaussian Splatting, in this paper we propose using freely positioned 3D Gaussians to create a summarized representation of a radar point cloud tolerant to sensor noise, and subsequently leverage its inherent probability distribution function for registration (similar to NDT). Moreover, we propose simultaneously optimizing multiple scan matching hypotheses in order to further increase the robustness of the system against local optima of the function. Finally, we fuse our Gaussian modeling and scan matching algorithms into an EKF radar-inertial odometry system designed after current best practices. Experiments show that our Gaussian-based odometry is able to outperform current baselines on a well-known 4D radar dataset used for evaluation.",

Recent methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have become the preferred method for this task, providing high-quality novel views in real time. However, the training time of a 3DGS model is slow, often taking 30 minutes for a scene with 200 views. In contrast, our goal is to reduce the optimization time by training for fewer steps while maintaining high rendering quality. Specifically, we combine the guidance from both the position error and the appearance error to achieve a more effective densification. To balance the rate between adding new Gaussians and fitting old Gaussians, we develop a convergence-aware budget control mechanism. Moreover, to make the densification process more reliable, we selectively add new Gaussians from mostly visited regions. With these designs, we reduce the Gaussian optimization steps to one-third of the previous approach while achieving a comparable or even better novel view rendering quality. To further facilitate the rapid fitting of 4K resolution images, we introduce a dilation-based rendering technique. Our method, Turbo-GS, speeds up optimization for typical scenes and scales well to high-resolution (4K) scenarios on standard datasets. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method is significantly faster in optimization than other methods while retaining quality. Project page: https://ivl.cs.brown.edu/research/turbo-gs.",

To address these issues, we develop Vivar, a novel AR system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D volumetric content for visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding space through barycentric interpolation. This allows for accurate and continuous integration of multi-modal sensor information. Vivar also incorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition, Vivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR content generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system achieves 11$\\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality.

    "abstract": "Real-time free-view human rendering from sparse-view RGB inputs is a challenging task due to the sensor scarcity and the tight time budget. To ensure efficiency, recent methods leverage 2D CNNs operating in texture space to learn rendering primitives. However, they either jointly learn geometry and appearance, or completely ignore sparse image information for geometry estimation, significantly harming visual quality and robustness to unseen body poses. To address these issues, we present Double Unprojected Textures, which at the core disentangles coarse geometric deformation estimation from appearance synthesis, enabling robust and photorealistic 4K rendering in real-time. Specifically, we first introduce a novel image-conditioned template deformation network, which estimates the coarse deformation of the human template from a first unprojected texture. This updated geometry is then used to apply a second and more accurate texture unprojection. The resulting texture map has fewer artifacts and better alignment with input views, which benefits our learning of finer-level geometry and appearance represented by Gaussian splats. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in quantitative and qualitative experiments, which significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) from a monocular endoscopy video can enable autonomous navigation, guidance to unsurveyed regions, and 3D visualizations, which can significantly improve endoscopy experience for surgeons and patient outcomes. Existing dense SLAM algorithms often assume distant and static lighting and textured surfaces, and alternate between optimizing scene geometry and camera parameters by minimizing a photometric rendering loss, often called Photometric Bundle Adjustment. However, endoscopic environments exhibit dynamic near-field lighting due to the co-located light and camera moving extremely close to the surface, textureless surfaces, and strong specular reflections due to mucus layers. When not considered, these near-field lighting effects can cause significant performance reductions for existing SLAM algorithms from indoor/outdoor scenes when applied to endoscopy videos. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a new Near-Field Lighting Bundle Adjustment Loss $(L_{NFL-BA})$ that can also be alternatingly optimized, along with the Photometric Bundle Adjustment loss, such that the captured images' intensity variations match the relative distance and orientation between the surface and the co-located light and camera. We derive a general NFL-BA loss function for 3D Gaussian surface representations and demonstrate that adding $L_{NFL-BA}$ can significantly improve the tracking and mapping performance of two state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM systems, MonoGS (35% improvement in tracking, 48% improvement in mapping with predicted depth maps) and EndoGSLAM (22% improvement in tracking, marginal improvement in mapping with predicted depths), on the C3VD endoscopy dataset for colons.

Existing methods often produce suboptimal results or require excessive computation time. In this work, we propose 4D radiative Gaussian splatting (4DRGS) to achieve high-quality reconstruction efficiently. In detail, we represent the vessels with 4D radiative Gaussian kernels. Each kernel has time-invariant geometry parameters, including position, rotation, and scale, to model static vessel structures. The time-dependent central attenuation of each kernel is predicted from a compact neural network to capture the temporal varying response of contrast agent flow. We splat these Gaussian kernels to synthesize DSA images via X-ray rasterization and optimize the model with real captured ones. The final 3D vessel volume is voxelized from the well-trained kernels. Moreover, we introduce accumulated attenuation pruning and bounded scaling activation to improve reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on real-world patient data demonstrate that 4DRGS achieves impressive results in 5 minutes training, which is 32x faster than the state-of-the-art method. This underscores the potential of 4DRGS for real-world clinics.",

These approaches create a 3D radiance field, parameterized by per-pixel 3D Gaussian primitives, from just a few images in a single forward pass. However, unlike multi-view methods that benefit from cross-view correspondences, 3D scene reconstruction with a single-view image remains an underexplored area. In this work, we introduce CATSplat, a novel generalizable transformer-based framework designed to break through the inherent constraints in monocular settings. First, we propose leveraging textual guidance from a visual-language model to complement insufficient information from a single image. By incorporating scene-specific contextual details from text embeddings through cross-attention, we pave the way for context-aware 3D scene reconstruction beyond relying solely on visual cues. Moreover, we advocate utilizing spatial guidance from 3D point features toward comprehensive geometric understanding under single-view settings. With 3D priors, image features can capture rich structural insights for predicting 3D Gaussians without multi-view techniques. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CATSplat in single-view 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality novel view synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as the go-to representation for reconstructing and rendering 3D scenes. The transition from 3D to 2D Gaussian primitives has further improved multi-view consistency and surface reconstruction accuracy. In this work we highlight the similarity between 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) and billboards from traditional computer graphics. Both use flat semi-transparent 2D geometry that is positioned, oriented and scaled in 3D space. However 2DGS uses a solid color per splat and an opacity modulated by a Gaussian distribution, where billboards are more expressive, modulating the color with a uv-parameterized texture. We propose to unify these concepts by presenting Gaussian Billboards, a modification of 2DGS to add spatially-varying color achieved using per-splat texture interpolation. The result is a mixture of the two representations, which benefits from both the robust scene optimization power of 2DGS and the expressiveness of texture mapping. We show that our method can improve the sharpness and quality of the scene representation in a wide range of qualitative and quantitative evaluations compared to the original 2DGS implementation.",

Recent methods address these limitations by tracing volumetric particles instead, however, this comes at the cost of significantly slower rendering speeds. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian Unscented Transform (3DGUT), replacing the EWA splatting formulation in 3DGS with the Unscented Transform that approximates the particles through sigma points, which can be projected exactly under any nonlinear projection function. This modification enables trivial support of distorted cameras with time dependent effects such as rolling shutter, while retaining the efficiency of rasterization. Additionally, we align our rendering formulation with that of tracing-based methods, enabling secondary ray tracing required to represent phenomena such as reflections and refraction within the same 3D representation.",

We propose a novel pipeline to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale reconstruction model that uses latents from a video diffusion model to predict 3D Gaussian Splattings for the scenes in a feed-forward manner. The video diffusion model is designed to create videos precisely following specified camera trajectories, allowing it to generate compressed video latents that contain multi-view information while maintaining 3D consistency. We train the 3D reconstruction model to operate on the video latent space with a progressive training strategy, enabling the efficient generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes. Extensive evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing methods for single-view 3D scene generation, particularly with out-of-domain images. For the first time, we demonstrate that a 3D reconstruction model can be effectively built upon the latent space of a diffusion model to realize efficient 3D scene generation.",

Event cameras, with their high temporal resolution and ability to capture asynchronous brightness changes, offer a promising alternative for more reliable scene reconstruction without motion blur. In this paper, we propose SweepEvGS, a novel hardware-integrated method that leverages event cameras for robust and accurate novel view synthesis across various imaging settings from a single sweep. SweepEvGS utilizes the initial static frame with dense event streams captured during a single camera sweep to effectively reconstruct detailed scene views. We also introduce different real-world hardware imaging systems for real-world data collection and evaluation for future research. We validate the robustness and efficiency of SweepEvGS through experiments in three different imaging settings: synthetic objects, real-world macro-level, and real-world micro-level view synthesis. Our results demonstrate that SweepEvGS surpasses existing methods in visual rendering quality, rendering speed, and computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for dynamic practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in 3D editing have highlighted the potential of text-driven methods in real-time, user-friendly AR/VR applications. However, current methods rely on 2D diffusion models without adequately considering multi-view information, resulting in multi-view inconsistency. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) significantly improves rendering quality and speed, its 3D editing process encounters difficulties with inefficient optimization, as pre-trained Gaussians retain excessive source information, hindering optimization. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{EditSplat}, a novel 3D editing framework that integrates Multi-view Fusion Guidance (MFG) and Attention-Guided Trimming (AGT). Our MFG ensures multi-view consistency by incorporating essential multi-view information into the diffusion process, leveraging classifier-free guidance from the text-to-image diffusion model and the geometric properties of 3DGS. Additionally, our AGT leverages the explicit representation of 3DGS to selectively prune and optimize 3D Gaussians, enhancing optimization efficiency and enabling precise, semantically rich local edits. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, EditSplat achieves superior multi-view consistency and editing quality over existing methods, significantly enhancing overall efficiency.",

However, this area remains under-explored due to the inherent ambiguities in physical property estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianProperty, a training-free framework that assigns physical properties of materials to 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we integrate the segmentation capability of SAM with the recognition capability of GPT-4V(ision) to formulate a global-local physical property reasoning module for 2D images. Then we project the physical properties from multi-view 2D images to 3D Gaussians using a voting strategy. We demonstrate that 3D Gaussians with physical property annotations enable applications in physics-based dynamic simulation and robotic grasping. For physics-based dynamic simulation, we leverage the Material Point Method (MPM) for realistic dynamic simulation. For robot grasping, we develop a grasping force prediction strategy that estimates a safe force range required for object grasping based on the estimated physical properties. Extensive experiments on material segmentation, physics-based dynamic simulation, and robotic grasping validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, highlighting its crucial role in understanding physical properties from visual data.

To incorporate sequential inputs, most existing methods fuse representations from previous frames to infer the current 3D occupancy. However, they fail to consider the continuity of driving scenarios and ignore the strong prior provided by the evolution of 3D scenes (e.g., only dynamic objects move). In this paper, we propose a world-model-based framework to exploit the scene evolution for perception. We reformulate 3D occupancy prediction as a 4D occupancy forecasting problem conditioned on the current sensor input. We decompose the scene evolution into three factors: 1) ego motion alignment of static scenes; 2) local movements of dynamic objects; and 3) completion of newly-observed scenes. We then employ a Gaussian world model (GaussianWorld) to explicitly exploit these priors and infer the scene evolution in the 3D Gaussian space considering the current RGB observation. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework on the widely used nuScenes dataset. Our GaussianWorld improves the performance of the single-frame counterpart by over 2% in mIoU without introducing additional computations. Code: https://github.com/zuosc19/GaussianWorld.",

Most existing methods adopt dense representations (e.g., bird's eye view) or sparse representations (e.g., instance boxes) for decision-making, which suffer from the trade-off between comprehensiveness and efficiency. This paper explores a Gaussian-centric end-to-end autonomous driving (GaussianAD) framework and exploits 3D semantic Gaussians to extensively yet sparsely describe the scene. We initialize the scene with uniform 3D Gaussians and use surrounding-view images to progressively refine them to obtain the 3D Gaussian scene representation. We then use sparse convolutions to efficiently perform 3D perception (e.g., 3D detection, semantic map construction). We predict 3D flows for the Gaussians with dynamic semantics and plan the ego trajectory accordingly with an objective of future scene forecasting. Our GaussianAD can be trained in an end-to-end manner with optional perception labels when available. Extensive experiments on the widely used nuScenes dataset verify the effectiveness of our end-to-end GaussianAD on various tasks including motion planning, 3D occupancy prediction, and 4D occupancy forecasting.

While the vanilla Gaussian Splatting representation is mainly designed for view synthesis, more recent works investigated how to extend it with scene understanding and language features. However, existing methods lack a detailed comprehension of scenes, limiting their ability to segment and interpret complex structures. To this end, We introduce SuperGSeg, a novel approach that fosters cohesive, context-aware scene representation by disentangling segmentation and language field distillation. SuperGSeg first employs neural Gaussians to learn instance and hierarchical segmentation features from multi-view images with the aid of off-the-shelf 2D masks. These features are then leveraged to create a sparse set of what we call Super-Gaussians. Super-Gaussians facilitate the distillation of 2D language features into 3D space. Through Super-Gaussians, our method enables high-dimensional language feature rendering without extreme increases in GPU memory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGSeg outperforms prior works on both open-vocabulary object localization and semantic segmentation tasks.",

Photorealistic 3D head avatar reconstruction from such recordings is challenging due to limited observations, which leaves unobserved regions under-constrained and can lead to artifacts in novel views. To address this problem, we introduce a multi-view head diffusion model, leveraging its priors to fill in missing regions and ensure view consistency in Gaussian splatting renderings. To enable precise viewpoint control, we use normal maps rendered from FLAME-based head reconstruction, which provides pixel-aligned inductive biases. We also condition the diffusion model on VAE features extracted from the input image to preserve details of facial identity and appearance. For Gaussian avatar reconstruction, we distill multi-view diffusion priors by using iteratively denoised images as pseudo-ground truths, effectively mitigating over-saturation issues. To further improve photorealism, we apply latent upsampling to refine the denoised latent before decoding it into an image. We evaluate our method on the NeRSemble dataset, showing that GAF outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis by a 5.34\\% higher SSIM score. Furthermore, we demonstrate higher-fidelity avatar reconstructions from monocular videos captured on commodity devices.",

RP-SLAM decouples camera poses estimation from Gaussian primitives optimization and consists of three key components. Firstly, we propose an efficient incremental mapping approach to achieve a compact and accurate representation of the scene through adaptive sampling and Gaussian primitives filtering. Secondly, a dynamic window optimization method is proposed to mitigate the forgetting problem and improve map consistency.

MAC-Ego3D enables agents to independently construct, align, and iteratively refine local maps using a unified Gaussian splat representation. Through Intra-Agent Gaussian Consensus, it enforces spatial coherence among neighboring Gaussian splats within an agent. For global alignment, parallelized Inter-Agent Gaussian Consensus, which asynchronously aligns and optimizes local maps by regularizing multi-agent Gaussian splats, seamlessly integrates them into a high-fidelity 3D model.

MAC-Ego3D bridges local precision and global coherence, delivering higher efficiency, largely reducing localization error, and improving mapping fidelity. It establishes a new SOTA on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, achieving a 15x increase in inference speed, order-of-magnitude reductions in ego-motion estimation error for partial cases, and RGB PSNR gains of 4 to 10 dB.

Our method addresses a key limitation in most NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches: they estimate view-dependent appearance without modeling scene materials and illumination. To address this limitation, we present an inverse rendering (IR) model capable of jointly estimating scene geometry, materials, and illumination. Our model builds upon recent NeRF-based IR approaches, but crucially introduces two novel physics-based priors that better constrain the IR estimation. Our priors are rigorously formulated as intuitive loss terms and achieve state-of-the-art material estimation without compromising novel view synthesis quality. Our method is easily adaptable to other inverse rendering and 3D reconstruction frameworks that require material estimation. We demonstrate the importance of extending current neural rendering approaches to fully model scene properties beyond geometry and view-dependent appearance.

    "abstract": "This paper aims to address the challenge of reconstructing long volumetric videos from multi-view RGB videos. Recent dynamic view synthesis methods leverage powerful 4D representations, like feature grids or point cloud sequences, to achieve high-quality rendering results. However, they are typically limited to short (1~2s) video clips and often suffer from large memory footprints when dealing with longer videos. To solve this issue, we propose a novel 4D representation, named Temporal Gaussian Hierarchy, to compactly model long volumetric videos. Our key observation is that there are generally various degrees of temporal redundancy in dynamic scenes, which consist of areas changing at different speeds. Motivated by this, our approach builds a multi-level hierarchy of 4D Gaussian primitives, where each level separately describes scene regions with different degrees of content change, and adaptively shares Gaussian primitives to represent unchanged scene content over different temporal segments, thus effectively reducing the number of Gaussian primitives. In addition, the tree-like structure of the Gaussian hierarchy allows us to efficiently represent the scene at a particular moment with a subset of Gaussian primitives, leading to nearly constant GPU memory usage during the training or rendering regardless of the video length. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over alternative methods in terms of training cost, rendering speed, and storage usage. To our knowledge, this work is the first approach capable of efficiently handling minutes of volumetric video data while maintaining state-of-the-art rendering quality.

    "abstract": "Given that visual foundation models (VFMs) are trained on extensive datasets but often limited to 2D images, a natural question arises: how well do they understand the 3D world? With the differences in architecture and training protocols (i.e., objectives, proxy tasks), a unified framework to fairly and comprehensively probe their 3D awareness is urgently needed. Existing works on 3D probing suggest single-view 2.5D estimation (e.g., depth and normal) or two-view sparse 2D correspondence (e.g., matching and tracking). Unfortunately, these tasks ignore texture awareness, and require 3D data as ground-truth, which limits the scale and diversity of their evaluation set. To address these issues, we introduce Feat2GS, which readout 3D Gaussians attributes from VFM features extracted from unposed images. This allows us to probe 3D awareness for geometry and texture via novel view synthesis, without requiring 3D data. Additionally, the disentanglement of 3DGS parameters - geometry ($\\boldsymbol{x}, \\alpha, \\Sigma$) and texture ($\\boldsymbol{c}$) - enables separate analysis of texture and geometry awareness. Under Feat2GS, we conduct extensive experiments to probe the 3D awareness of several VFMs, and investigate the ingredients that lead to a 3D aware VFM. Building on these findings, we develop several variants that achieve state-of-the-art across diverse datasets. This makes Feat2GS useful for probing VFMs, and as a simple-yet-effective baseline for novel-view synthesis. Code and data will be made available at https://fanegg.github.io/Feat2GS/.",

    "abstract": "Single-image 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to inherent geometric ambiguities and limited viewpoint information. Recent advances in Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) offer promising 3D priors learned from large-scale video data. However, leveraging these priors effectively faces three key challenges: (1) degradation in quality across large camera motions, (2) difficulties in achieving precise camera control, and (3) geometric distortions inherent to the diffusion process that damage 3D consistency. We address these challenges by proposing LiftImage3D, a framework that effectively releases LVDMs' generative priors while ensuring 3D consistency. Specifically, we design an articulated trajectory strategy to generate video frames, which decomposes video sequences with large camera motions into ones with controllable small motions. Then we use robust neural matching models, i.e. MASt3R, to calibrate the camera poses of generated frames and produce corresponding point clouds. Finally, we propose a distortion-aware 3D Gaussian splatting representation, which can learn independent distortions between frames and output undistorted canonical Gaussians. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiftImage3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets, i.e. LLFF, DL3DV, and Tanks and Temples, and generalizes well to diverse in-the-wild images, from cartoon illustrations to complex real-world scenes.",

Current text-driven human avatar generation methods either model hair, clothing, and the human body using a unified geometry or produce hair and garments that are not easily adaptable for simulation within existing simulation pipelines. The primary challenge lies in representing the hair and garment geometry in a way that allows leveraging established prior knowledge from foundational image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) while being simulation-ready using either physics or neural simulators. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework that combines the flexibility of 3D Gaussians with simulation-ready hair strands and garment meshes. Specifically, we first employ three text-conditioned 3D generative models to generate garment mesh, body shape and hair strands from the given text prompt. To leverage prior knowledge from foundational diffusion models, we attach 3D Gaussians to the body mesh, garment mesh, as well as hair strands and learn the avatar appearance through optimization. To drive the avatar given a pose sequence, we first apply physics simulators onto the garment meshes and hair strands. We then transfer the motion onto 3D Gaussians through carefully designed mechanisms for each body part. As a result, our synthesized avatars have vivid texture and realistic dynamic motion. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to produce highly realistic, fully simulation-ready 3D avatars, surpassing the capabilities of current approaches.",

We propose GEAL, a novel framework designed to enhance the generalization and robustness of 3D affordance learning by leveraging large-scale pre-trained 2D models. We employ a dual-branch architecture with Gaussian splatting to establish consistent mappings between 3D point clouds and 2D representations, enabling realistic 2D renderings from sparse point clouds. A granularity-adaptive fusion module and a 2D-3D consistency alignment module further strengthen cross-modal alignment and knowledge transfer, allowing the 3D branch to benefit from the rich semantics and generalization capacity of 2D models. To holistically assess the robustness, we introduce two new corruption-based benchmarks: PIAD-C and LASO-C. Extensive experiments on public datasets and our benchmarks show that GEAL consistently outperforms existing methods across seen and novel object categories, as well as corrupted data, demonstrating robust and adaptable affordance prediction under diverse conditions.

In this paper, we propose LIVE-GS, a highly realistic interactive VR system powered by LLM. After object-aware GS reconstruction, we prompt GPT-4o to analyze the physical properties of objects in the scene, which are used to guide physical simulations consistent with real phenomena. We also design a GPT-assisted GS inpainting module to fill the unseen area covered by manipulative objects. To perform a precise segmentation of Gaussian kernels, we propose a feature-mask segmentation strategy. To enable rich interaction, we further propose a computationally efficient physical simulation framework through an PBD-based unified interpolation method, supporting various physical forms such as rigid body, soft body, and granular materials. Our experimental results show that with the help of LLM's understanding and enhancement of scenes, our VR system can support complex and realistic interactions without additional manual design and annotation.",

Recently, methods based on radiance fields have received increasing attention due to their ability to synthesize high-fidelity and identity-consistent talking heads from just a few minutes of training video. However, due to the limited scale of the training data, these methods often exhibit poor performance in audio-lip synchronization and visual quality. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian-based method called PointTalk, which constructs a static 3D Gaussian field of the head and deforms it in sync with the audio. It also incorporates an audio-driven dynamic lip point cloud as a critical component of the conditional information, thereby facilitating the effective synthesis of talking heads. Specifically, the initial step involves generating the corresponding lip point cloud from the audio signal and capturing its topological structure. The design of the dynamic difference encoder aims to capture the subtle nuances inherent in dynamic lip movements more effectively. Furthermore, we integrate the audio-point enhancement module, which not only ensures the synchronization of the audio signal with the corresponding lip point cloud within the feature space, but also facilitates a deeper understanding of the interrelations among cross-modal conditional features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior high-fidelity and audio-lip synchronization in talking head synthesis compared to previous methods.",

Recent Gaussian-based 3D reconstruction techniques have achieved impressive results in recovering high-fidelity 3D assets from sparse input images by predicting 3D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. However, these techniques often lack the extensive priors and expressiveness offered by Diffusion Models. On the other hand, 2D Diffusion Models, which have been successfully applied to denoise multiview images, show potential for generating a wide range of photorealistic 3D outputs but still fall short on explicit 3D priors and consistency. In this work, we aim to bridge these two approaches by introducing DSplats, a novel method that directly denoises multiview images using Gaussian Splat-based Reconstructors to produce a diverse array of realistic 3D assets. To harness the extensive priors of 2D Diffusion Models, we incorporate a pretrained Latent Diffusion Model into the reconstructor backbone to predict a set of 3D Gaussians. Additionally, the explicit 3D representation embedded in the denoising network provides a strong inductive bias, ensuring geometrically consistent novel view generation. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DSplats not only produces high-quality, spatially consistent outputs, but also sets a new standard in single-image to 3D reconstruction. When evaluated on the Google Scanned Objects dataset, DSplats achieves a PSNR of 20.38, an SSIM of 0.842, and an LPIPS of 0.109.",

However, achieving desired 3D editing results often requires multiple adjustments in an iterative loop, resulting in tens of minutes of training time cost for each attempt and a cumbersome trial-and-error cycle for users. This in-the-loop training paradigm results in a poor user experience. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of process-oriented modelling for 3D editing and propose the Progressive Gaussian Differential Field (ProGDF), an out-of-loop training approach that requires only a single training session to provide users with controllable editing capability and variable editing results through a user-friendly interface in real-time. ProGDF consists of two key components: Progressive Gaussian Splatting (PGS) and Gaussian Differential Field (GDF). PGS introduces the progressive constraint to extract the diverse intermediate results of the editing process and employs rendering quality regularization to improve the quality of these results. Based on these intermediate results, GDF leverages a lightweight neural network to model the editing process. Extensive results on two novel applications, namely controllable 3D editing and flexible fine-grained 3D manipulation, demonstrate the effectiveness, practicality and flexibility of the proposed ProGDF.",

Injecting these warped features into other viewpoints enables coherent propagation of edits, achieving high fidelity and spatial alignment in 3D space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating versatile edits of 3D scenes, significantly advancing the capabilities of scene manipulation compared to the existing methods.

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting has changed the game for real-time photo-realistic rendering. One of the most popular applications of Gaussian Splatting is to create animatable avatars, known as Gaussian Avatars. Recent works have pushed the boundaries of quality and rendering efficiency but suffer from two main limitations. Either they require expensive multi-camera rigs to produce avatars with free-view rendering, or they can be trained with a single camera but only rendered at high quality from this fixed viewpoint. An ideal model would be trained using a short monocular video or image from available hardware, such as a webcam, and rendered from any view. To this end, we propose GASP: Gaussian Avatars with Synthetic Priors. To overcome the limitations of existing datasets, we exploit the pixel-perfect nature of synthetic data to train a Gaussian Avatar prior. By fitting this prior model to a single photo or video and fine-tuning it, we get a high-quality Gaussian Avatar, which supports 360$^\\circ$ rendering. Our prior is only required for fitting, not inference, enabling real-time application. Through our method, we obtain high-quality, animatable Avatars from limited data which can be animated and rendered at 70fps on commercial hardware.

Traditional 3D building asset creation is labor-intensive and requires specialized skills to develop design rules. Recent generative models for building creation often overlook these patterns, leading to low visual fidelity and limited scalability.

By manipulating procedural code, we can streamline this process and generate an infinite variety of buildings. This integration significantly reduces model size by utilizing shared foundational assets, enabling scalable generation with precise control over building assembly. We showcase the potential for expansive cityscape generation while maintaining high rendering fidelity and precise control on both real and synthetic cases.",

However, it often struggles to capture rich details and complete geometry. Our analysis highlights a key limitation of 3D-GS caused by the fixed threshold in densification, which balances geometry coverage against detail recovery as the threshold varies. To address this, we introduce a novel densification method, residual split, which adds a downscaled Gaussian as a residual. Our approach is capable of adaptively retrieving details and complementing missing geometry while enabling progressive refinement. To further support this method, we propose a pipeline named ResGS. Specifically, we integrate a Gaussian image pyramid for progressive supervision and implement a selection scheme that prioritizes the densification of coarse Gaussians over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering quality. Consistent performance improvements can be achieved by applying our residual split on various 3D-GS variants, underscoring its versatility and potential for broader application in 3D-GS-based applications.",

When dealing with more than two views, a combinatorial number of error prone pairwise reconstructions are usually followed by an expensive global optimization, which often fails to rectify the pairwise reconstruction errors. To handle more views, reduce errors, and improve inference time, we propose the fast single-stage feed-forward network MV-DUSt3R. At its core are multi-view decoder blocks which exchange information across any number of views while considering one reference view. To make our method robust to reference view selection, we further propose MV-DUSt3R+, which employs cross-reference-view blocks to fuse information across different reference view choices. To further enable novel view synthesis, we extend both by adding and jointly training Gaussian splatting heads. Experiments on multi-view stereo reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, and novel view synthesis confirm that our methods improve significantly upon prior art. Code will be released.",

    "abstract": "Recent 4D reconstruction methods have yielded impressive results but rely on sharp videos as supervision. However, motion blur often occurs in videos due to camera shake and object movement, while existing methods render blurry results when using such videos for reconstructing 4D models. Although a few NeRF-based approaches attempted to address the problem, they struggled to produce high-quality results, due to the inaccuracy in estimating continuous dynamic representations within the exposure time. Encouraged by recent works in 3D motion trajectory modeling using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), we suggest taking 3DGS as the scene representation manner, and propose the first 4D Gaussian Splatting framework to reconstruct a high-quality 4D model from blurry monocular video, named Deblur4DGS. Specifically, we transform continuous dynamic representations estimation within an exposure time into the exposure time estimation. Moreover, we introduce exposure regularization to avoid trivial solutions, as well as multi-frame and multi-resolution consistency ones to alleviate artifacts. Furthermore, to better represent objects with large motion, we suggest blur-aware variable canonical Gaussians. Beyond novel-view synthesis, Deblur4DGS can be applied to improve blurry video from multiple perspectives, including deblurring, frame interpolation, and video stabilization. Extensive experiments on the above four tasks show that Deblur4DGS outperforms state-of-the-art 4D reconstruction methods. The codes are available at https://github.com/ZcsrenlongZ/Deblur4DGS.",

However, synthesizing novel views from these panoramic images in real time remains a significant challenge, especially due to panoramic imagery's high resolution and inherent distortions. Although existing 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) methods can produce photo-realistic views under narrow baselines, they often overfit the training views when dealing with wide-baseline panoramic images due to the difficulty in learning precise geometry from sparse 360$^{\\circ}$ views. This paper presents \\textit{Splatter-360}, a novel end-to-end generalizable 3DGS framework designed to handle wide-baseline panoramic images.

Additionally, we introduce a 3D-aware bi-projection encoder to mitigate the distortions inherent in panoramic images and integrate cross-view attention to improve feature interactions across multiple viewpoints. This enables robust 3D-aware feature representations and real-time rendering capabilities. Experimental results on the HM3D~\\cite{hm3d} and Replica~\\cite{replica} demonstrate that \\textit{Splatter-360} significantly outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF and 3DGS methods (e.g., PanoGRF, MVSplat, DepthSplat, and HiSplat) in both synthesis quality and generalization performance for wide-baseline panoramic images.

In this paper, we propose Generative Densification, an efficient and generalizable method to densify Gaussians generated by feed-forward models.

More specifically, the neural bundle adjustment module integrates a foundation network to produce initial 3D point maps and point matches from unposed images, followed by bundle adjustment optimization to improve multiview consistency and point cloud accuracy. The generative depth refinement module employs a diffusion-based strategy to enhance geometric details and fidelity while preserving the scale. Finally, for Gaussian splatting optimization, we propose a multimodal loss function incorporating depth and normal consistency, geometric regularization, and pseudo-view supervision, providing robust guidance under sparse-view conditions. Experiments on widely used datasets show that GBR significantly outperforms existing methods under sparse-view inputs.

    "abstract": "Effective compression technology is crucial for 3DGS to adapt to varying storage and transmission conditions. However, existing methods fail to address size constraints while maintaining optimal quality. In this paper, we introduce SizeGS, a framework that compresses 3DGS within a specified size budget while optimizing visual quality. We start with a size estimator to establish a clear relationship between file size and hyperparameters. Leveraging this estimator, we incorporate mixed precision quantization (MPQ) into 3DGS attributes, structuring MPQ in two hierarchical level -- inter-attribute and intra-attribute -- to optimize visual quality under the size constraint. At the inter-attribute level, we assign bit-widths to each attribute channel by formulating the combinatorial optimization as a 0-1 integer linear program, which can be efficiently solved. At the intra-attribute level, we divide each attribute channel into blocks of vectors, quantizing each vector based on the optimal bit-width derived at the inter-attribute level. Dynamic programming determines block lengths. Using the size estimator and MPQ, we develop a calibrated algorithm to identify optimal hyperparameters in just 10 minutes, achieving a 1.69$\\times$ efficiency increase with quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction have leveraged dynamic 3D Gaussians and 4D Gaussian Splatting for realistic scene representation. However, to make these methods viable for real-time applications such as AR/VR, gaming, and rendering on low-power devices, substantial reductions in memory usage and improvements in rendering efficiency are required. While many state-of-the-art methods prioritize lightweight implementations, they struggle in handling scenes with complex motions or long sequences. In this work, we introduce Temporally Compressed 3D Gaussian Splatting (TC3DGS), a novel technique designed specifically to effectively compress dynamic 3D Gaussian representations. TC3DGS selectively prunes Gaussians based on their temporal relevance and employs gradient-aware mixed-precision quantization to dynamically compress Gaussian parameters. It additionally relies on a variation of the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm in a post-processing step to further reduce storage by interpolating Gaussian trajectories across frames. Our experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that TC3DGS achieves up to 67$\\times$ compression with minimal or no degradation in visual quality.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for 3D scene representation, providing rapid rendering speeds and high fidelity. As 3DGS gains prominence, safeguarding its intellectual property becomes increasingly crucial since 3DGS could be used to imitate unauthorized scene creations and raise copyright issues. Existing watermarking methods for implicit NeRFs cannot be directly applied to 3DGS due to its explicit representation and real-time rendering process, leaving watermarking for 3DGS largely unexplored. In response, we propose WATER-GS, a novel method designed to protect 3DGS copyrights through a universal watermarking strategy. First, we introduce a pre-trained watermark decoder, treating raw 3DGS generative modules as potential watermark encoders to ensure imperceptibility. Additionally, we implement novel 3D distortion layers to enhance the robustness of the embedded watermark against common real-world distortions of point cloud data. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that WATER-GS effectively embeds imperceptible and robust watermarks into 3DGS without compromising rendering efficiency and quality. Our experiments indicate that the 3D distortion layers can yield up to a 20% improvement in accuracy rate. Notably, our method is adaptable to different 3DGS variants, including 3DGS compression frameworks and 2D Gaussian splatting.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of computer vision, the recently emerged 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has increasingly become a popular scene reconstruction algorithm due to its outstanding performance. Distributed 3DGS can efficiently utilize edge devices to directly train on the collected images, thereby offloading computational demands and enhancing efficiency. However, traditional distributed frameworks often overlook computational and communication challenges in real-world environments, hindering large-scale deployment and potentially posing privacy risks. In this paper, we propose Radiant, a hierarchical 3DGS algorithm designed for large-scale scene reconstruction that considers system heterogeneity, enhancing the model performance and training efficiency. Via extensive empirical study, we find that it is crucial to partition the regions for each edge appropriately and allocate varying camera positions to each device for image collection and training. The core of Radiant is partitioning regions based on heterogeneous environment information and allocating workloads to each device accordingly. Furthermore, we provide a 3DGS model aggregation algorithm that enhances the quality and ensures the continuity of models' boundaries. Finally, we develop a testbed, and experiments demonstrate that Radiant improved reconstruction quality by up to 25.7\\% and reduced up to 79.6\\% end-to-end latency.",

At their core is Novel View Synthesis (NVS), a crucial capability that generates diverse unseen viewpoints to accommodate the broad and continuous pose distribution of AVs. Recent advances in radiance fields, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieve photorealistic rendering at real-time speeds and have been widely used in modeling large-scale driving scenes. However, their performance is commonly evaluated using an interpolated setup with highly correlated training and test views. In contrast, extrapolation, where test views largely deviate from training views, remains underexplored, limiting progress in generalizable simulation technology. To address this gap, we leverage publicly available AV datasets with multiple traversals, multiple vehicles, and multiple cameras to build the first Extrapolated Urban View Synthesis (EUVS) benchmark. Meanwhile, we conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations of state-of-the-art Gaussian Splatting methods across different difficulty levels. Our results show that Gaussian Splatting is prone to overfitting to training views. Besides, incorporating diffusion priors and improving geometry cannot fundamentally improve NVS under large view changes, highlighting the need for more robust approaches and large-scale training.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing high-fidelity 3D head avatars is crucial in various applications such as virtual reality. The pioneering methods reconstruct realistic head avatars with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), which have been limited by training and rendering speed. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) significantly improve the efficiency of training and rendering. However, the surface inconsistency of 3DGS results in subpar geometric accuracy; later, 2DGS uses 2D surfels to enhance geometric accuracy at the expense of rendering fidelity. To leverage the benefits of both 2DGS and 3DGS, we propose a novel method named MixedGaussianAvatar for realistically and geometrically accurate head avatar reconstruction. Our main idea is to utilize 2D Gaussians to reconstruct the surface of the 3D head, ensuring geometric accuracy. We attach the 2D Gaussians to the triangular mesh of the FLAME model and connect additional 3D Gaussians to those 2D Gaussians where the rendering quality of 2DGS is inadequate, creating a mixed 2D-3D Gaussian representation. These 2D-3D Gaussians can then be animated using FLAME parameters. We further introduce a progressive training strategy that first trains the 2D Gaussians and then fine-tunes the mixed 2D-3D Gaussians. We demonstrate the superiority of MixedGaussianAvatar through comprehensive experiments. The code will be released at: https://github.com/ChenVoid/MGA/.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting has demonstrated notable success in large-scale scene reconstruction, but challenges persist due to high training memory consumption and storage overhead. Hybrid representations that integrate implicit and explicit features offer a way to mitigate these limitations. However, when applied in parallelized block-wise training, two critical issues arise since reconstruction accuracy deteriorates due to reduced data diversity when training each block independently, and parallel training restricts the number of divided blocks to the available number of GPUs. To address these issues, we propose Momentum-GS, a novel approach that leverages momentum-based self-distillation to promote consistency and accuracy across the blocks while decoupling the number of blocks from the physical GPU count. Our method maintains a teacher Gaussian decoder updated with momentum, ensuring a stable reference during training. This teacher provides each block with global guidance in a self-distillation manner, promoting spatial consistency in reconstruction. To further ensure consistency across the blocks, we incorporate block weighting, dynamically adjusting each block's weight according to its reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes show that our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, achieving a 12.8% improvement in LPIPS over CityGaussian with much fewer divided blocks and establishing a new state of the art.

To address this challenge, we put forth WRF-GS, a novel framework for channel modeling based on wireless radiation field (WRF) reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting. WRF-GS employs 3D Gaussian primitives and neural networks to capture the interactions between the environment and radio signals, enabling efficient WRF reconstruction and visualization of the propagation characteristics. The reconstructed WRF can then be used to synthesize the spatial spectrum for comprehensive wireless channel characterization. Notably, with a small number of measurements, WRF-GS can synthesize new spatial spectra within milliseconds for a given scene, thereby enabling latency-sensitive applications. Experimental results demonstrate that WRF-GS outperforms existing methods for spatial spectrum synthesis, such as ray tracing and other deep-learning approaches. Moreover, WRF-GS achieves superior performance in the channel state information prediction task, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin of more than 2.43 dB.",

During training, it relies heavily on the average magnitude of view-space positional gradients to grow Gaussians to reduce rendering loss. However, this average operation smooths the positional gradients from different viewpoints and rendering errors from different pixels, hindering the growth and optimization of many defective Gaussians. This leads to strong spurious artifacts in some areas. To address this problem, we propose Hard Gaussian Splatting, dubbed HGS, which considers multi-view significant positional gradients and rendering errors to grow hard Gaussians that fill the gaps of classical Gaussian Splatting on 3D scenes, thus achieving superior NVS results. In detail, we present positional gradient driven HGS, which leverages multi-view significant positional gradients to uncover hard Gaussians. Moreover, we propose rendering error guided HGS, which identifies noticeable pixel rendering errors and potentially over-large Gaussians to jointly mine hard Gaussians. By growing and optimizing these hard Gaussians, our method helps to resolve blurring and needle-like artifacts.

    "abstract": "Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) streaming is a challenging problem, which is relatively under-explored. It requires incremental on-the-fly updates to a volumetric representation, fast training and rendering to satisfy real-time constraints and a small memory footprint for efficient transmission. If achieved, it can enhance user experience by enabling novel applications, e.g., 3D video conferencing and live volumetric video broadcast, among others. In this work, we propose a novel framework for QUantized and Efficient ENcoding (QUEEN) for streaming FVV using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). QUEEN directly learns Gaussian attribute residuals between consecutive frames at each time-step without imposing any structural constraints on them, allowing for high quality reconstruction and generalizability. To efficiently store the residuals, we further propose a quantization-sparsity framework, which contains a learned latent-decoder for effectively quantizing attribute residuals other than Gaussian positions and a learned gating module to sparsify position residuals. We propose to use the Gaussian viewspace gradient difference vector as a signal to separate the static and dynamic content of the scene. It acts as a guide for effective sparsity learning and speeds up training. On diverse FVV benchmarks, QUEEN outperforms the state-of-the-art online FVV methods on all metrics. Notably, for several highly dynamic scenes, it reduces the model size to just 0.7 MB per frame while training in under 5 sec and rendering at 350 FPS.

    "abstract": "We propose an efficient radiance field rendering algorithm that incorporates a rasterization process on sparse voxels without neural networks or 3D Gaussians. There are two key contributions coupled with the proposed system. The first is to render sparse voxels in the correct depth order along pixel rays by using dynamic Morton ordering. This avoids the well-known popping artifact found in Gaussian splatting. Second, we adaptively fit sparse voxels to different levels of detail within scenes, faithfully reproducing scene details while achieving high rendering frame rates. Our method improves the previous neural-free voxel grid representation by over 4db PSNR and more than 10x rendering FPS speedup, achieving state-of-the-art comparable novel-view synthesis results. Additionally, our neural-free sparse voxels are seamlessly compatible with grid-based 3D processing algorithms. We achieve promising mesh reconstruction accuracy by integrating TSDF-Fusion and Marching Cubes into our sparse grid system.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian splatting methods are emerging as a popular approach for converting multi-view image data into scene representations that allow view synthesis. In particular, there is interest in enabling view synthesis for dynamic scenes using only monocular input data -- an ill-posed and challenging problem. The fast pace of work in this area has produced multiple simultaneous papers that claim to work best, which cannot all be true. In this work, we organize, benchmark, and analyze many Gaussian-splatting-based methods, providing apples-to-apples comparisons that prior works have lacked. We use multiple existing datasets and a new instructive synthetic dataset designed to isolate factors that affect reconstruction quality. We systematically categorize Gaussian splatting methods into specific motion representation types and quantify how their differences impact performance. Empirically, we find that their rank order is well-defined in synthetic data, but the complexity of real-world data currently overwhelms the differences. Furthermore, the fast rendering speed of all Gaussian-based methods comes at the cost of brittleness in optimization. We summarize our experiments into a list of findings that can help to further progress in this lively problem setting. Project Webpage: https://lynl7130.github.io/MonoDyGauBench.github.io/",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel clothed human model that can be learned from multiview RGB videos, with a particular emphasis on recovering physically accurate body and cloth movements. Our method, Position Based Dynamic Gaussians (PBDyG), realizes ``movement-dependent'' cloth deformation via physical simulation, rather than merely relying on ``pose-dependent'' rigid transformations. We model the clothed human holistically but with two distinct physical entities in contact: clothing modeled as 3D Gaussians, which are attached to a skinned SMPL body that follows the movement of the person in the input videos. The articulation of the SMPL body also drives physically-based simulation of the clothes' Gaussians to transform the avatar to novel poses. In order to run position based dynamics simulation, physical properties including mass and material stiffness are estimated from the RGB videos through Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only accurately reproduces appearance but also enables the reconstruction of avatars wearing highly deformable garments, such as skirts or coats, which have been challenging to reconstruct using existing methods.",

    "abstract": "3D occupancy prediction provides a comprehensive description of the surrounding scenes and has become an essential task for 3D perception. Most existing methods focus on offline perception from one or a few views and cannot be applied to embodied agents which demands to gradually perceive the scene through progressive embodied exploration. In this paper, we formulate an embodied 3D occupancy prediction task to target this practical scenario and propose a Gaussian-based EmbodiedOcc framework to accomplish it. We initialize the global scene with uniform 3D semantic Gaussians and progressively update local regions observed by the embodied agent. For each update, we extract semantic and structural features from the observed image and efficiently incorporate them via deformable cross-attention to refine the regional Gaussians. Finally, we employ Gaussian-to-voxel splatting to obtain the global 3D occupancy from the updated 3D Gaussians. Our EmbodiedOcc assumes an unknown (i.e., uniformly distributed) environment and maintains an explicit global memory of it with 3D Gaussians. It gradually gains knowledge through the local refinement of regional Gaussians, which is consistent with how humans understand new scenes through embodied exploration. We reorganize an EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet benchmark based on local annotations to facilitate the evaluation of the embodied 3D occupancy prediction task. Experiments demonstrate that our EmbodiedOcc outperforms existing local prediction methods and accomplishes the embodied occupancy prediction with high accuracy and strong expandability.

Previous methods for scene generation either suffer from limited scales or lack geometric and appearance consistency along generated sequences. In contrast, we leverage the recent advancements in scalable 3D representation and video models to achieve large dynamic scene generation that allows flexible controls through HD maps, vehicle bounding boxes, and text descriptions. First, we construct a map-conditioned sparse-voxel-based 3D generative model to unleash its power for unbounded voxel world generation. Then, we re-purpose a video model and ground it on the voxel world through a set of carefully designed pixel-aligned guidance buffers, synthesizing a consistent appearance. Finally, we propose a fast feed-forward approach that employs both voxel and pixel branches to lift the dynamic videos to dynamic 3D Gaussians with controllable objects. Our method can generate controllable and realistic 3D driving scenes, and extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of our model.",

During training, depth maps generated by the deformable Gaussian splatting module guide the ray sampling for faster processing and provide depth supervision within the dynamic neural surface module to improve geometry reconstruction. Simultaneously, the dynamic neural surface directs the distribution of Gaussian primitives around the surface, enhancing rendering quality. To further refine depth supervision, we introduce a depth-filtering process on depth maps derived from Gaussian rasterization. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DGNS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.",

Note that, the 3DGS itself is better suited for modeling static scenes that assume multi-view consistency, but the transient objects appear occasionally and do not adhere to the assumption, thus we model them as planar objects from a single view, represented with 2D Gaussians. Our novel representation decomposes the scene from the perspective of fundamental viewpoint consistency, making it more reasonable. Additionally, we present a novel multi-view regulated supervision method for 3DGS that leverages information from co-visible regions, further enhancing the distinctions between the transients and statics. Then, we propose a straightforward yet effective multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust training and high-quality view synthesis across various settings.

Existing methods that attempt to model dynamic urban scenes without leveraging priors on potentially moving regions often produce suboptimal results. Meanwhile, approaches based on manual 3D annotations yield improved reconstruction quality but are impractical due to labor-intensive labeling. In this paper, we revisit the potential of 2D semantic maps for classifying dynamic and static Gaussians and integrating spatial and temporal dimensions for urban scene representation. We introduce Urban4D, a novel framework that employs a semantic-guided decomposition strategy inspired by advances in deep 2D semantic map generation. Our approach distinguishes potentially dynamic objects through reliable semantic Gaussians. To explicitly model dynamic objects, we propose an intuitive and effective 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) representation that aggregates temporal information through learnable time embeddings for each Gaussian, predicting their deformations at desired timestamps using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). For more accurate static reconstruction, we also design a k-nearest neighbor (KNN)-based consistency regularization to handle the ground surface due to its low-texture characteristic. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Urban4D not only achieves comparable or better quality than previous state-of-the-art methods but also effectively captures dynamic objects while maintaining high visual fidelity for static elements.",

However, its splatting-based rendering model makes several approximations to the rendering equation, reducing physical accuracy. We show that splatting and its approximations are unnecessary, even within a rasterizer; we instead volumetrically integrate 3D Gaussians directly to compute the transmittance across them analytically. We use this analytic transmittance to derive more physically-accurate alpha values than 3DGS, which can directly be used within their framework. The result is a method that more closely follows the volume rendering equation (similar to ray-tracing) while enjoying the speed benefits of rasterization. Our method represents opaque surfaces with higher accuracy and fewer points than 3DGS. This enables it to outperform 3DGS for view synthesis (measured in SSIM and LPIPS). Being volumetrically consistent also enables our method to work out of the box for tomography. We match the state-of-the-art 3DGS-based tomography method with fewer points.",

We demonstrate that a new multiscale loss based on global neural statistics, that we name SOS for Simultaneously Optimized Scales, enables style transfer to ultra-high resolution 3D scenes.

    "abstract": "Navigating outdoor environments with visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems poses significant challenges due to dynamic scenes, lighting variations, and seasonal changes, requiring robust solutions. While traditional SLAM methods struggle with adaptability, deep learning-based approaches and emerging neural radiance fields as well as Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM methods, offer promising alternatives. However, these methods have primarily been evaluated in controlled indoor environments with stable conditions, leaving a gap in understanding their performance in unstructured and variable outdoor settings. This study addresses this gap by evaluating these methods in natural outdoor environments, focusing on camera tracking accuracy, robustness to environmental factors, and computational efficiency, highlighting distinct trade-offs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that neural SLAM methods achieve superior robustness, particularly under challenging conditions such as low light, but at a high computational cost. At the same time, traditional methods perform the best across seasons but are highly sensitive to variations in lighting conditions.

Given the widespread application of 3DGS in 3D reconstruction and generation tasks, there is an urgent need to protect the copyright of 3DGS assets. However, existing copyright protection techniques for 3DGS overlook the usability of 3D assets, posing challenges for practical deployment. Here we describe WaterGS, the first 3DGS watermarking framework that embeds 3D content in 3DGS itself without modifying any attributes of the vanilla 3DGS. To achieve this, we take a deep insight into spherical harmonics (SH) and devise an importance-graded SH coefficient encryption strategy to embed the hidden SH coefficients. Furthermore, we employ a convolutional autoencoder to establish a mapping between the original Gaussian primitives' opacity and the hidden Gaussian primitives' opacity. Extensive experiments indicate that WaterGS significantly outperforms existing 3D steganography techniques, with 5.31% higher scene fidelity and 3X faster rendering speed, while ensuring security, robustness, and user experience.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting has advanced radiance field reconstruction, enabling high-quality view synthesis and fast rendering in 3D modeling. While adversarial attacks on object detection models are well-studied for 2D images, their impact on 3D models remains underexplored. This work introduces the Masked Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (M-IFGSM), designed to generate adversarial noise targeting the CLIP vision-language model. M-IFGSM specifically alters the object of interest by focusing perturbations on masked regions, degrading the performance of CLIP's zero-shot object detection capability when applied to 3D models. Using eight objects from the Common Objects 3D (CO3D) dataset, we demonstrate that our method effectively reduces the accuracy and confidence of the model, with adversarial noise being nearly imperceptible to human observers. The top-1 accuracy in original model renders drops from 95.4\\% to 12.5\\% for train images and from 91.2\\% to 35.4\\% for test images, with confidence levels reflecting this shift from true classification to misclassification, underscoring the risks of adversarial attacks on 3D models in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance.

Existing 3D reconstruction methods often struggle to capture fine details in animatable models, while generative approaches for controllable animation, though avoiding explicit 3D modeling, suffer from viewpoint inconsistencies in extreme poses and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging the power of generative models to produce detailed multi-view canonical pose images, which help resolve ambiguities in animatable human reconstruction. We then propose a robust method for 3D reconstruction of inconsistent images, enabling real-time rendering during inference. Specifically, we adapt a transformer-based video generation model to generate multi-view canonical pose images and normal maps, pretraining on a large-scale video dataset to improve generalization. To handle view inconsistencies, we recast the reconstruction problem as a 4D task and introduce an efficient 3D modeling approach using 4D Gaussian Splatting. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves photorealistic, real-time animation of 3D human avatars from in-the-wild images, showcasing its effectiveness and generalization capability.",

    "abstract": "Producing emotionally dynamic 3D facial avatars with text derived from spoken words (Emo3D) has been a pivotal research topic in 3D avatar generation. While progress has been made in general-purpose 3D avatar generation, the exploration of generating emotional 3D avatars remains scarce, primarily due to the complexities of identifying and rendering rich emotions from spoken words. This paper reexamines Emo3D generation and draws inspiration from human processes, breaking down Emo3D into two cascading steps: Text-to-3D Expression Mapping (T3DEM) and 3D Avatar Rendering (3DAR). T3DEM is the most crucial step in determining the quality of Emo3D generation and encompasses three key challenges: Expression Diversity, Emotion-Content Consistency, and Expression Fluidity. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel benchmark to advance research in Emo3D generation. First, we present EmoAva, a large-scale, high-quality dataset for T3DEM, comprising 15,000 text-to-3D expression mappings that characterize the aforementioned three challenges in Emo3D generation. Furthermore, we develop various metrics to effectively evaluate models against these identified challenges. Next, to effectively model the consistency, diversity, and fluidity of human expressions in the T3DEM step, we propose the Continuous Text-to-Expression Generator, which employs an autoregressive Conditional Variational Autoencoder for expression code generation, enhanced with Latent Temporal Attention and Expression-wise Attention mechanisms. Finally, to further enhance the 3DAR step on rendering higher-quality subtle expressions, we present the Globally-informed Gaussian Avatar (GiGA) model. GiGA incorporates a global information mechanism into 3D Gaussian representations, enabling the capture of subtle micro-expressions and seamless transitions between emotional states.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic scenes with large-scale and complex motions remains a significant challenge. Recent techniques like Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promise but still struggle with scenes involving substantial movement. This paper proposes RelayGS, a novel method based on 3DGS, specifically designed to represent and reconstruct highly dynamic scenes. Our RelayGS learns a complete 4D representation with canonical 3D Gaussians and a compact motion field, consisting of three stages. First, we learn a fundamental 3DGS from all frames, ignoring temporal scene variations, and use a learnable mask to separate the highly dynamic foreground from the minimally moving background. Second, we replicate multiple copies of the decoupled foreground Gaussians from the first stage, each corresponding to a temporal segment, and optimize them using pseudo-views constructed from multiple frames within each segment. These Gaussians, termed Relay Gaussians, act as explicit relay nodes, simplifying and breaking down large-scale motion trajectories into smaller, manageable segments. Finally, we jointly learn the scene's temporal motion and refine the canonical Gaussians learned from the first two stages. We conduct thorough experiments on two dynamic scene datasets featuring large and complex motions, where our RelayGS outperforms state-of-the-arts by more than 1 dB in PSNR, and successfully reconstructs real-world basketball game scenes in a much more complete and coherent manner, whereas previous methods usually struggle to capture the complex motion of players.

    "abstract": "We present TimeWalker, a novel framework that models realistic, full-scale 3D head avatars of a person on lifelong scale. Unlike current human head avatar pipelines that capture identity at the momentary level(e.g., instant photography or short videos), TimeWalker constructs a person's comprehensive identity from unstructured data collection over his/her various life stages, offering a paradigm to achieve full reconstruction and animation of that person at different moments of life. At the heart of TimeWalker's success is a novel neural parametric model that learns personalized representation with the disentanglement of shape, expression, and appearance across ages. Central to our methodology are the concepts of two aspects: (1) We track back to the principle of modeling a person's identity in an additive combination of average head representation in the canonical space, and moment-specific head attribute representations driven from a set of neural head basis. To learn the set of head basis that could represent the comprehensive head variations in a compact manner, we propose a Dynamic Neural Basis-Blending Module (Dynamo). It dynamically adjusts the number and blend weights of neural head bases, according to both shared and specific traits of the target person over ages. (2) Dynamic 2D Gaussian Splatting (DNA-2DGS), an extension of Gaussian splatting representation, to model head motion deformations like facial expressions without losing the realism of rendering and reconstruction. DNA-2DGS includes a set of controllable 2D oriented planar Gaussian disks that utilize the priors from parametric model, and move/rotate with the change of expression. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we show TimeWalker's ability to reconstruct and animate avatars across decoupled dimensions with realistic rendering effects, demonstrating a way to achieve personalized 'time traveling' in a breeze.",

Recent efforts have successfully integrated physically grounded dynamics within 3D Gaussians to perform high-fidelity simulations in well-reconstructed simulation environments from static scenes. However, they struggle with the geometric inconsistency in reconstructing simulation environments and unrealistic physical deformations in simulations of soft tissues when it comes to dynamic and complex surgical processes. In this paper, we propose SurgiSim, a novel automatic simulation system to overcome these limitations. To build a surgical simulation environment, we maintain a canonical 3D scene composed of 3D Gaussians coupled with a deformation field to represent a dynamic surgical scene. This process involves a multi-stage optimization with trajectory and anisotropic regularization, enhancing the geometry consistency of the canonical scene, which serves as the simulation environment. To achieve realistic physical simulations in this environment, we implement a Visco-Elastic deformation model based on the Maxwell model, effectively restoring the complex deformations of tissues. Additionally, we infer the physical parameters of tissues by minimizing the discrepancies between the input video and simulation results guided by estimated tissue motion, ensuring realistic simulation outcomes. Experiments on various surgical scenarios and interactions demonstrate SurgiSim's ability to perform realistic simulation of soft tissues among surgical procedures, showing its enormous potential for enhancing surgical training, planning, and robotic surgery systems.

Although depth estimation algorithms can be employed, geometric inaccuracy can lead to failures in RGBD-based pose tracking methods. To address this challenge, we introduce GSGTrack, a novel RGB-based pose tracking framework that jointly optimizes geometry and pose. Specifically, we adopt 3D Gaussian Splatting to create an optimizable 3D representation, which is learned simultaneously with a graph-based geometry optimization to capture the object's appearance features and refine its geometry. However, the joint optimization process is susceptible to perturbations from noisy pose and geometry data. Thus, we propose an object silhouette loss to address the issue of pixel-wise loss being overly sensitive to pose noise during tracking. To mitigate the geometric ambiguities caused by inaccurate depth information, we propose a geometry-consistent image pair selection strategy, which filters out low-confidence pairs and ensures robust geometric optimization. Extensive experiments on the OnePose and HO3D datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSGTrack in both 6DoF pose tracking and object reconstruction.",

Additionally, task-driven planning based on surface uncertainty is prone to being trapped in local optima. To this end, we propose the first 3DGS-based centralized multi-robot autonomous 3D reconstruction framework. To further reduce time cost of task generation and improve reconstruction quality, we integrate online open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with surface uncertainty of 3DGS, focusing view sampling on regions with high instance uncertainty. Finally, we develop a multi-robot collaboration strategy with mode and task assignments improving reconstruction quality while ensuring planning efficiency.

    "abstract": "Recently, several studies have combined Gaussian Splatting to obtain scene representations with language embeddings for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. While these methods perform well, they essentially require very dense multi-view inputs, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose SparseLGS to address the challenge of 3D scene understanding with pose-free and sparse view input images. Our method leverages a learning-based dense stereo model to handle pose-free and sparse inputs, and a three-step region matching approach to address the multi-view semantic inconsistency problem, which is especially important for sparse inputs. Different from directly learning high-dimensional CLIP features, we extract low-dimensional information and build bijections to avoid excessive learning and storage costs. We introduce a reconstruction loss during semantic training to improve Gaussian positions and shapes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the 3D semantic field problem with sparse pose-free inputs. Experimental results show that SparseLGS achieves comparable quality when reconstructing semantic fields with fewer inputs (3-4 views) compared to previous SOTA methods with dense input. Besides, when using the same sparse input, SparseLGS leads significantly in quality and heavily improves the computation speed (5$\\times$speedup). Project page: https://ustc3dv.github.io/SparseLGS",

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis under sparse views has been a long-term important challenge in 3D reconstruction. Existing works mainly rely on introducing external semantic or depth priors to supervise the optimization of 3D representations. However, the diffusion model, as an external prior that can directly provide visual supervision, has always underperformed in sparse-view 3D reconstruction using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) due to the low information entropy of sparse views compared to text, leading to optimization challenges caused by mode deviation. To this end, we present a thorough analysis of SDS from the mode-seeking perspective and propose Inline Prior Guided Score Matching (IPSM), which leverages visual inline priors provided by pose relationships between viewpoints to rectify the rendered image distribution and decomposes the original optimization objective of SDS, thereby offering effective diffusion visual guidance without any fine-tuning or pre-training. Furthermore, we propose the IPSM-Gaussian pipeline, which adopts 3D Gaussian Splatting as the backbone and supplements depth and geometry consistency regularization based on IPSM to further improve inline priors and rectified distribution. Experimental results on different public datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. The code is released at https://github.com/iCVTEAM/IPSM.",

The PGS leverages Gaussian primitives to model the scene and employ a hierarchical Gaussian mixture approach to group them. Similar Gaussians are progressively merged probabilistically in the tree-structured Gaussian mixtures to identify distinct 3D plane instances and form the overall 3D scene geometry. In order to enable the grouping, the Gaussian primitives contain additional parameters, such as plane descriptors derived by lifting 2D masks from a general 2D segmentation model and surface normals. Experiments show that the proposed PGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D planar reconstruction without requiring either 3D plane labels or depth supervision. In contrast to existing supervised methods that have limited generalizability and struggle under domain shift, PGS maintains its performance across datasets thanks to its neural rendering and scene-specific optimization mechanism, while also being significantly faster than existing optimization-based approaches.",

We proposed a novel method to align the 2D surfels with texture maps and augment it with per-ray depth sorting and fisher-based pruning for rendering consistency and efficiency. With correct order, per-surfel texture maps significantly improve the capabilities to capture fine details. Additionally, to render high-fidelity details in varying viewpoints, we designed a frustum-based sampling method to mitigate the aliasing artifacts.

    "abstract": "TL;DR: Gaussian Splatting is a widely adopted approach for 3D scene representation that offers efficient, high-quality 3D reconstruction and rendering. A major reason for the success of 3DGS is its simplicity of representing a scene with a set of Gaussians, which makes it easy to interpret and adapt. To enhance scene understanding beyond the visual representation, approaches have been developed that extend 3D Gaussian Splatting with semantic vision-language features, especially allowing for open-set tasks. In this setting, the language features of 3D Gaussian Splatting are often aggregated from multiple 2D views. Existing works address this aggregation problem using cumbersome techniques that lead to high computational cost and training time.   In this work, we show that the sophisticated techniques for language-grounded 3D Gaussian Splatting are simply unnecessary. Instead, we apply Occam's razor to the task at hand and perform weighted multi-view feature aggregation using the weights derived from the standard rendering process, followed by a simple heuristic-based noisy Gaussian filtration. Doing so offers us state-of-the-art results with a speed-up of two orders of magnitude. We showcase our results in two commonly used benchmark datasets: LERF and 3D-OVS. Our simple approach allows us to perform reasoning directly in the language features, without any compression whatsoever. Such modeling in turn offers easy scene manipulation, unlike the existing methods -- which we illustrate using an application of object insertion in the scene. Furthermore, we provide a thorough discussion regarding the significance of our contributions within the context of the current literature.

In our work, we introduce a novel framework that first fine-tunes the InstructPix2Pix model, followed by a two-stage optimization of the scene based on deformable 3D Gaussians. Our fine-tuning enables the model to \"learn\" the editing ability from a single edited reference image, transforming the complex task of dynamic scene editing into a simple 2D image editing process. By directly learning editing regions and styles from the reference, our approach enables consistent and precise local edits without the need for tracking desired editing regions, effectively addressing key challenges in dynamic scene editing. Then, our two-stage optimization progressively edits the trained dynamic scene, using a designed edited image buffer to accelerate convergence and improve temporal consistency. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach offers more flexible and controllable local scene editing, achieving high-quality and consistent results.",

To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel free-form driving view synthesis approach, dubbed DriveX, by leveraging video generative prior to optimize a 3D model across a variety of trajectories. Concretely, we crafted an inverse problem that enables a video diffusion model to be utilized as a prior for many-trajectory optimization of a parametric 3D model (e.g., Gaussian splatting). To seamlessly use the generative prior, we iteratively conduct this process during optimization. Our resulting model can produce high-fidelity virtual driving environments outside the recorded trajectory, enabling free-form trajectory driving simulation. Beyond real driving scenes, DriveX can also be utilized to simulate virtual driving worlds from AI-generated videos.",

We propose a novel inpainting method that combines diffusion models with anisotropic Gaussian splatting to capture both local structures and global context effectively. By modeling missing regions using anisotropic Gaussian functions that adapt to local image gradients, our approach provides structural guidance to the diffusion-based inpainting network.

However, current techniques for editing complex 3D scenes continue to rely on generally interactive multi-step, 2D-to-3D projection methods and diffusion-based techniques, which often lack precision in control and hamper real-time performance.

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \\& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.",

Dynamics, sparse views, and unknown poses significantly increase the problem complexity due to insufficient geometric constraints. To overcome this challenge, we propose a method that can use only two images without prior poses to fit Gaussians in dynamic environments. To achieve this, we introduce two technical contributions. First, we propose an object-level two-view bundle adjustment. This strategy decomposes dynamic scenes into piece-wise rigid components, and jointly estimates the camera pose and motions of dynamic objects. Second, we design an SE(3) field-driven Gaussian training method. It enables fine-grained motion modeling through learnable per-Gaussian transformations. Our method leads to high-fidelity novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes while accurately preserving temporal consistency and object motion. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches designed for the cases of static environments, multiple images, and/or known poses.

This paper introduces ChatSplat, a system that constructs a 3D language field, enabling rich chat-based interaction within 3D space. Unlike existing methods that primarily use CLIP-derived language features focused solely on segmentation, ChatSplat facilitates interaction on three levels: objects, views, and the entire 3D scene. For view-level interaction, we designed an encoder that encodes the rendered feature map of each view into tokens, which are then processed by a large language model (LLM) for conversation. At the scene level, ChatSplat combines multi-view tokens, enabling interactions that consider the entire scene. For object-level interaction, ChatSplat uses a patch-wise language embedding, unlike LangSplat's pixel-wise language embedding that implicitly includes mask and embedding. Here, we explicitly decouple the language embedding into separate mask and feature map representations, allowing more flexible object-level interaction. To address the challenge of learning 3D Gaussians posed by the complex and diverse distribution of language embeddings used in the LLM, we introduce a learnable normalization technique to standardize these embeddings, facilitating effective learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ChatSplat supports multi-level interactions -- object, view, and scene -- within 3D space, enhancing both understanding and engagement.",

Existing methods rely on deterministic, feed-forward predictions, which limit their ability to handle the inherent ambiguity of 3D inference from 2D data. Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative models for 3D data, including Gaussian splats; however, standard diffusion frameworks typically require the target signal and denoised signal to be in the same modality, which is challenging given the scarcity of 3D data. To overcome this, we propose a novel training strategy that decouples the denoised modality from the supervision modality. By using a deterministic model as a noisy teacher to create the noised signal and transitioning from single-step to multi-step denoising supervised by an image rendering loss, our approach significantly enhances performance compared to the deterministic teacher. Additionally, our method is flexible, as it can learn from various 3D Gaussian Splat (3DGS) teachers with minimal adaptation; we demonstrate this by surpassing the performance of two different deterministic models as teachers, highlighting the potential generalizability of our framework. Our approach further incorporates a guidance mechanism to aggregate information from multiple views, enhancing reconstruction quality when more than one view is available. Experimental results on object-level and scene-level datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",

In this paper, we identify and address two key inefficiencies in 3D-GS, achieving substantial improvements in rendering speed, model size, and training time. First, we optimize the rendering pipeline to precisely localize Gaussians in the scene, boosting rendering speed without altering visual fidelity. Second, we introduce a novel pruning technique and integrate it into the training pipeline, significantly reducing model size and training time while further raising rendering speed. Our Speedy-Splat approach combines these techniques to accelerate average rendering speed by a drastic $6.71\\times$ across scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets with $10.6\\times$ fewer primitives than 3D-GS.",

We explore different fine-tuning strategies to obtain both multiview generation and inpainting capabilities within the same diffusion model. In particular, the design of the inpainting mask is an important factor of training an inpainting model, and we propose several masking strategies to mimic the types of edits a user would perform on a 3D shape.

    "abstract": "Abstract representations of 3D scenes play a crucial role in computer vision, enabling a wide range of applications such as mapping, localization, surface reconstruction, and even advanced tasks like SLAM and rendering. Among these representations, line segments are widely used because of their ability to succinctly capture the structural features of a scene. However, existing 3D reconstruction methods often face significant challenges. Methods relying on 2D projections suffer from instability caused by errors in multi-view matching and occlusions, while direct 3D approaches are hampered by noise and sparsity in 3D point cloud data. This paper introduces LineGS, a novel method that combines geometry-guided 3D line reconstruction with a 3D Gaussian splatting model to address these challenges and improve representation ability. The method leverages the high-density Gaussian point distributions along the edge of the scene to refine and optimize initial line segments generated from traditional geometric approaches. By aligning these segments with the underlying geometric features of the scene, LineGS achieves a more precise and reliable representation of 3D structures. The results show significant improvements in both geometric accuracy and model compactness compared to baseline methods.",

To address this, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework named GradiSeg, incorporating Identity Encoding to construct a deeper semantic understanding of scenes. Our approach introduces two key modules: Identity Gradient Guided Densification (IGD) and Local Adaptive K-Nearest Neighbors (LA-KNN). The IGD module supervises gradients of Identity Encoding to refine Gaussian distributions along object boundaries, aligning them closely with boundary contours. Meanwhile, the LA-KNN module employs position gradients to adaptively establish locality-aware propagation of Identity Encodings, preventing irregular Gaussian spreads near boundaries. We validate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments. Results show that GradiSeg effectively addresses boundary-related issues, significantly improving segmentation accuracy without compromising scene reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our method's robust segmentation capability and decoupled Identity Encoding representation make it highly suitable for various downstream scene editing tasks, including 3D object removal, swapping and so on.",

In this paper, we unveil a fresh approach that blends state-space modeling with Wasserstein geometry, paving the way for a more fluid and coherent representation of dynamic scenes. We introduce a State Consistency Filter that merges prior predictions with the current observations, enabling Gaussians to stay true to their way over time. We also employ Wasserstein distance regularization to ensure smooth, consistent updates of Gaussian parameters, reducing motion artifacts. Lastly, we leverage Wasserstein geometry to capture both translational motion and shape deformations, creating a more physically plausible model for dynamic scenes. Our approach guides Gaussians along their natural way in the Wasserstein space, achieving smoother, more realistic motion and stronger temporal coherence. Experimental results show significant improvements in rendering quality and efficiency, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques.",

In this paper, we propose GuardSplat, an innovative and efficient framework that effectively protects the copyright of 3DGS assets. Specifically, 1) We first propose a CLIP-guided Message Decoupling Optimization module for training the message decoder, leveraging CLIP's aligning capability and rich representations to achieve a high extraction accuracy with minimal optimization costs, presenting exceptional capability and efficiency. 2) Then, we propose a Spherical-harmonic-aware (SH-aware) Message Embedding module tailored for 3DGS, which employs a set of SH offsets to seamlessly embed the message into the SH features of each 3D Gaussian while maintaining the original 3D structure. It enables the 3DGS assets to be watermarked with minimal fidelity trade-offs and prevents malicious users from removing the messages from the model files, meeting the demands for invisibility and security. 3) We further propose an Anti-distortion Message Extraction module to improve robustness against various visual distortions.

Most existing methods rely on external semantic information from pre-trained models, introducing additional computational overhead as pre-processing steps or during optimization. In this work, we propose a novel method, DeSplat, that directly separates distractors and static scene elements purely based on volume rendering of Gaussian primitives. We initialize Gaussians within each camera view for reconstructing the view-specific distractors to separately model the static 3D scene and distractors in the alpha compositing stages. DeSplat yields an explicit scene separation of static elements and distractors, achieving comparable results to prior distractor-free approaches without sacrificing rendering speed.

Developing an effective and efficient algorithm that is capable of automatically generating high-quality PBR materials rather than RGB texture for 3D meshes can significantly streamline the 3D content creation. Most existing methods leverage pre-trained 2D diffusion models for multi-view image synthesis, which often leads to severe inconsistency between the generated textures and input 3D meshes. This paper presents TexGaussian, a novel method that uses octant-aligned 3D Gaussian Splatting for rapid PBR material generation. Specifically, we place each 3D Gaussian on the finest leaf node of the octree built from the input 3D mesh to render the multiview images not only for the albedo map but also for roughness and metallic. Moreover, our model is trained in a regression manner instead of diffusion denoising, capable of generating the PBR material for a 3D mesh in a single feed-forward process. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our method synthesizes more visually pleasing PBR materials and runs faster than previous methods in both unconditional and text-conditional scenarios, which exhibit better consistency with the given geometry.

Traditionally, TDOM generation involves a complex set of traditional photogrammetric process, which may deteriorate due to various challenges, including inaccurate Digital Surface Model (DSM), degenerated occlusion detections, and visual artifacts in weak texture regions and reflective surfaces, etc. To address these challenges, we introduce TOrtho-Gaussian, a novel method inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that generates TDOMs through orthogonal splatting of optimized anisotropic Gaussian kernel. More specifically, we first simplify the orthophoto generation by orthographically splatting the Gaussian kernels onto 2D image planes, formulating a geometrically elegant solution that avoids the need for explicit DSM and occlusion detection. Second, to produce TDOM of large-scale area, a divide-and-conquer strategy is adopted to optimize memory usage and time efficiency of training and rendering for 3DGS. Lastly, we design a fully anisotropic Gaussian kernel that adapts to the varying characteristics of different regions, particularly improving the rendering quality of reflective surfaces and slender structures. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing commercial software in several aspects, including the accuracy of building boundaries, the visual quality of low-texture regions and building facades. These results underscore the potential of our approach for large-scale urban scene reconstruction, offering a robust alternative for enhancing TDOM quality and scalability.",

As a result, 3D reconstruction methods robust on in-air scenes, like Neural Radiance Field methods (NeRFs) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), fail on underwater scenes. While a recent underwater adaptation of NeRFs achieved state-of-the-art results, it is impractically slow: reconstruction takes hours and its rendering rate, in frames per second (FPS), is less than 1. Here, we present a new method that takes only a few minutes for reconstruction and renders novel underwater scenes at 140 FPS. Named Gaussian Splashing, our method unifies the strengths and speed of 3DGS with an image formation model for capturing scattering, introducing innovations in the rendering and depth estimation procedures and in the 3DGS loss function. Despite the complexities of underwater adaptation, our method produces images at unparalleled speeds with superior details. Moreover, it reveals distant scene details with far greater clarity than other methods, dramatically improving reconstructed and rendered images.

    "abstract": "Injecting semantics into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently garnered significant attention. While current approaches typically distill 3D semantic features from 2D foundational models (e.g., CLIP and SAM) to facilitate novel view segmentation and semantic understanding, their heavy reliance on 2D supervision can undermine cross-view semantic consistency and necessitate complex data preparation processes, therefore hindering view-consistent scene understanding. In this work, we present FreeGS, an unsupervised semantic-embedded 3DGS framework that achieves view-consistent 3D scene understanding without the need for 2D labels. Instead of directly learning semantic features, we introduce the IDentity-coupled Semantic Field (IDSF) into 3DGS, which captures both semantic representations and view-consistent instance indices for each Gaussian. We optimize IDSF with a two-step alternating strategy: semantics help to extract coherent instances in 3D space, while the resulting instances regularize the injection of stable semantics from 2D space. Additionally, we adopt a 2D-3D joint contrastive loss to enhance the complementarity between view-consistent 3D geometry and rich semantics during the bootstrapping process, enabling FreeGS to uniformly perform tasks such as novel-view semantic segmentation, object selection, and 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on LERF-Mask, 3D-OVS, and ScanNet datasets demonstrate that FreeGS performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods while avoiding the complex data preprocessing workload.",

However, reconstructing high-quality surfaces with fine details using 3D Gaussians remains a challenging task. In this work, we introduce GausSurf, a novel approach to high-quality surface reconstruction by employing geometry guidance from multi-view consistency in texture-rich areas and normal priors in texture-less areas of a scene. We observe that a scene can be mainly divided into two primary regions: 1) texture-rich and 2) texture-less areas. To enforce multi-view consistency at texture-rich areas, we enhance the reconstruction quality by incorporating a traditional patch-match based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) approach to guide the geometry optimization in an iterative scheme. This scheme allows for mutual reinforcement between the optimization of Gaussians and patch-match refinement, which significantly improves the reconstruction results and accelerates the training process. Meanwhile, for the texture-less areas, we leverage normal priors from a pre-trained normal estimation model to guide optimization. Extensive experiments on the DTU and Tanks and Temples datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction quality and computation time.",

    "abstract": "Precisely modeling radio propagation in complex environments has been a significant challenge, especially with the advent of 5G and beyond networks, where managing massive antenna arrays demands more detailed information. Traditional methods, such as empirical models and ray tracing, often fall short, either due to insufficient details or because of challenges for real-time applications. Inspired by the newly proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting method in the computer vision domain, which outperforms other methods in reconstructing optical radiance fields, we propose RF-3DGS, a novel approach that enables precise site-specific reconstruction of radio radiance fields from sparse samples. RF-3DGS can render radio spatial spectra at arbitrary positions within 2 ms following a brief 3-minute training period, effectively identifying dominant propagation paths. Furthermore, RF-3DGS can provide fine-grained Spatial Channel State Information (Spatial-CSI) of these paths, including the channel gain, the delay, the angle of arrival (AoA), and the angle of departure (AoD). Our experiments, calibrated through real-world measurements, demonstrate that RF-3DGS not only significantly improves reconstruction quality, training efficiency, and rendering speed compared to state-of-the-art methods, but also holds great potential for supporting wireless communication and advanced applications such as Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC).

In this work, we introduce Select Any Material (SAMa), a material selection approach for various 3D representations. Building on the recently introduced SAM2 video selection model, we extend its capabilities to the material domain. We leverage the model's cross-view consistency to create a 3D-consistent intermediate material-similarity representation in the form of a point cloud from a sparse set of views. Nearest-neighbour lookups in this similarity cloud allow us to efficiently reconstruct accurate continuous selection masks over objects' surfaces that can be inspected from any view. Our method is multiview-consistent by design, alleviating the need for contrastive learning or feature-field pre-processing, and performs optimization-free selection in seconds. Our approach works on arbitrary 3D representations and outperforms several strong baselines in terms of selection accuracy and multiview consistency. It enables several compelling applications, such as replacing the diffuse-textured materials on a text-to-3D output, or selecting and editing materials on NeRFs and 3D-Gaussians.",

    "abstract": "Photorealistic 3D vehicle models with high controllability are essential for autonomous driving simulation and data augmentation. While handcrafted CAD models provide flexible controllability, free CAD libraries often lack the high-quality materials necessary for photorealistic rendering. Conversely, reconstructed 3D models offer high-fidelity rendering but lack controllability. In this work, we introduce UrbanCAD, a framework that pushes the frontier of the photorealism-controllability trade-off by generating highly controllable and photorealistic 3D vehicle digital twins from a single urban image and a collection of free 3D CAD models and handcrafted materials. These digital twins enable realistic 360-degree rendering, vehicle insertion, material transfer, relighting, and component manipulation such as opening doors and rolling down windows, supporting the construction of long-tail scenarios. To achieve this, we propose a novel pipeline that operates in a retrieval-optimization manner, adapting to observational data while preserving flexible controllability and fine-grained handcrafted details. Furthermore, given multi-view background perspective and fisheye images, we approximate environment lighting using fisheye images and reconstruct the background with 3DGS, enabling the photorealistic insertion of optimized CAD models into rendered novel view backgrounds. Experimental results demonstrate that UrbanCAD outperforms baselines based on reconstruction and retrieval in terms of photorealism. Additionally, we show that various perception models maintain their accuracy when evaluated on UrbanCAD with in-distribution configurations but degrade when applied to realistic out-of-distribution data generated by our method. This suggests that UrbanCAD is a significant advancement in creating photorealistic, safety-critical driving scenarios for downstream applications.",

Effectively integrating semantic information into 3D reconstruction enables holistic representation that opens opportunities for immersive and interactive applications. We introduce SADG, Segment Any Dynamic Gaussian Without Object Trackers, a novel approach that combines dynamic Gaussian Splatting representation and semantic information without reliance on object IDs. In contrast to existing works, we do not rely on supervision based on object identities to enable consistent segmentation of dynamic 3D objects. To this end, we propose to learn semantically-aware features by leveraging masks generated from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and utilizing our novel contrastive learning objective based on hard pixel mining. The learned Gaussian features can be effectively clustered without further post-processing. This enables fast computation for further object-level editing, such as object removal, composition, and style transfer by manipulating the Gaussians in the scene. We further extend several dynamic novel-view datasets with segmentation benchmarks to enable testing of learned feature fields from unseen viewpoints. We evaluate SADG on proposed benchmarks and demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in segmenting objects within dynamic scenes along with its effectiveness for further downstream editing tasks.",

    "abstract": "Geometric priors are often used to enhance 3D reconstruction. With many smartphones featuring low-resolution depth sensors and the prevalence of off-the-shelf monocular geometry estimators, incorporating geometric priors as regularization signals has become common in 3D vision tasks. However, the accuracy of depth estimates from mobile devices is typically poor for highly detailed geometry, and monocular estimators often suffer from poor multi-view consistency and precision. In this work, we propose an approach for joint surface depth and normal refinement of Gaussian Splatting methods for accurate 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes. We develop supervision strategies that adaptively filters low-quality depth and normal estimates by comparing the consistency of the priors during optimization. We mitigate regularization in regions where prior estimates have high uncertainty or ambiguities. Our filtering strategy and optimization design demonstrate significant improvements in both mesh estimation and novel-view synthesis for both 3D and 2D Gaussian Splatting-based methods on challenging indoor room datasets. Furthermore, we explore the use of alternative meshing strategies for finer geometry extraction. We develop a scale-aware meshing strategy inspired by TSDF and octree-based isosurface extraction, which recovers finer details from Gaussian models compared to other commonly used open-source meshing tools.

Recent end-to-end methods that directly regress camera poses from query images have gained attention for fast inference. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize to unseen views. In this work, we aim to unleash the power of data synthesis to promote the generalizability of pose regression. Specifically, we lift real 2D images into 3D Gaussian Splats with varying appearance and deblurring abilities, which are then used as a data engine to synthesize more posed images. To fully leverage the synthetic data, we build a two-branch joint training pipeline, with an adversarial discriminator to bridge the syn-to-real gap. Experiments on established benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end approaches, reducing translation and rotation errors by 50% and 21.6% on indoor datasets, and 35.56% and 38.7% on outdoor datasets. We also validate the effectiveness of our method in dynamic driving scenarios under varying weather conditions. Notably, as data synthesis scales up, our method exhibits a growing ability to interpolate and extrapolate training data for localizing unseen views. Project Page: https://ai4ce.github.io/RAP/",

    "abstract": "3D scene understanding has become an essential area of research with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach, combining explicit modeling with neural adaptability to provide efficient and detailed scene representations. However, three major challenges remain in leveraging 3DGS for scene understanding: 1) an imbalance between appearance and semantics, where dense Gaussian usage for fine-grained texture modeling does not align with the minimal requirements for semantic attributes; 2) inconsistencies between appearance and semantics, as purely appearance-based Gaussians often misrepresent object boundaries; and 3) reliance on top-down instance segmentation methods, which struggle with uneven category distributions, leading to over- or under-segmentation. In this work, we propose InstanceGaussian, a method that jointly learns appearance and semantic features while adaptively aggregating instances. Our contributions include: i) a novel Semantic-Scaffold-GS representation balancing appearance and semantics to improve feature representations and boundary delineation; ii) a progressive appearance-semantic joint training strategy to enhance stability and segmentation accuracy; and iii) a bottom-up, category-agnostic instance aggregation approach that addresses segmentation challenges through farthest point sampling and connected component analysis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in category-agnostic, open-vocabulary 3D point-level segmentation, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed representation and training strategies.

To breathe life into the static world, we propose Gaussians2Life, a method for animating parts of high-quality 3D scenes in a Gaussian Splatting representation. Our key idea is to leverage powerful video diffusion models as the generative component of our model and to combine these with a robust technique to lift 2D videos into meaningful 3D motion. We find that, in contrast to prior work, this enables realistic animations of complex, pre-existing 3D scenes and further enables the animation of a large variety of object classes, while related work is mostly focused on prior-based character animation, or single 3D objects. Our model enables the creation of consistent, immersive 3D experiences for arbitrary scenes.",

    "abstract": "Given a single image of a target object, image-to-3D generation aims to reconstruct its texture and geometric shape. Recent methods often utilize intermediate media, such as multi-view images or videos, to bridge the gap between input image and the 3D target, thereby guiding the generation of both shape and texture. However, inconsistencies in the generated multi-view snapshots frequently introduce noise and artifacts along object boundaries, undermining the 3D reconstruction process. To address this challenge, we leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for 3D reconstruction, and explicitly integrate uncertainty-aware learning into the reconstruction process. By capturing the stochasticity between two Gaussian models, we estimate an uncertainty map, which is subsequently used for uncertainty-aware regularization to rectify the impact of inconsistencies. Specifically, we optimize both Gaussian models simultaneously, calculating the uncertainty map by evaluating the discrepancies between rendered images from identical viewpoints. Based on the uncertainty map, we apply adaptive pixel-wise loss weighting to regularize the models, reducing reconstruction intensity in high-uncertainty regions. This approach dynamically detects and mitigates conflicts in multi-view labels, leading to smoother results and effectively reducing artifacts. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in improving 3D generation quality by reducing inconsistencies and artifacts.",

However, pixels covered by the same Gaussian are always shaded in the same color up to a Gaussian falloff scaling factor. Furthermore, the finest geometric detail any individual Gaussian can represent is a simple ellipsoid. These properties of 3DGS greatly limit the expressivity of individual Gaussian primitives. To address these issues, we draw inspiration from texture and alpha mapping in traditional graphics and integrate it with 3DGS. Specifically, we propose a new generalized Gaussian appearance representation that augments each Gaussian with alpha~(A), RGB, or RGBA texture maps to model spatially varying color and opacity across the extent of each Gaussian. As such, each Gaussian can represent a richer set of texture patterns and geometric structures, instead of just a single color and ellipsoid as in naive Gaussian Splatting. Surprisingly, we found that the expressivity of Gaussians can be greatly improved by using alpha-only texture maps, and further augmenting Gaussians with RGB texture maps achieves the highest expressivity. We validate our method on a wide variety of standard benchmark datasets and our own custom captures at both the object and scene levels. We demonstrate image quality improvements over existing methods while using a similar or lower number of Gaussians.",

Given an input image, we first generate consistent multi-view images for components of the assets. These images are then fitted with 3D Gaussian Splatting representations. To ensure that the Gaussians representing objects are physically compatible with each other, we introduce a Physical Simulation-Enhanced Score Distillation Sampling (PSE-SDS) technique to further optimize the positions of the Gaussians. It is achieved by setting the gradient of the SDS loss as the initial velocity of the physical simulation, allowing the simulator to act as a physics-guided optimizer that progressively corrects the Gaussians' positions to a physically compatible state. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate physically plausible compositional 3D assets given a single image.",

    "abstract": "Pre-training on large-scale unlabeled datasets contribute to the model achieving powerful performance on 3D vision tasks, especially when annotations are limited. However, existing rendering-based self-supervised frameworks are computationally demanding and memory-intensive during pre-training due to the inherent nature of volume rendering. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework named GS$^3$ to learn point cloud representation, which seamlessly integrates fast 3D Gaussian Splatting into the rendering-based framework. The core idea behind our framework is to pre-train the point cloud encoder by comparing rendered RGB images with real RGB images, as only Gaussian points enriched with learned rich geometric and appearance information can produce high-quality renderings. Specifically, we back-project the input RGB-D images into 3D space and use a point cloud encoder to extract point-wise features. Then, we predict 3D Gaussian points of the scene from the learned point cloud features and uses a tile-based rasterizer for image rendering. Finally, the pre-trained point cloud encoder can be fine-tuned to adapt to various downstream 3D tasks, including high-level perception tasks such as 3D segmentation and detection, as well as low-level tasks such as 3D scene reconstruction. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate the strong transferability of the pre-trained point cloud encoder and the effectiveness of our self-supervised learning framework. In addition, our GS$^3$ framework is highly efficient, achieving approximately 9$\\times$ pre-training speedup and less than 0.25$\\times$ memory cost compared to the previous rendering-based framework Ponder.",

    "abstract": "Fast progress in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made 3D Gaussians popular for 3D modeling and image rendering, but this creates big challenges in data storage and transmission. To obtain a highly compact 3DGS representation, we propose a hybrid entropy model for Gaussian Splatting (HEMGS) data compression, which comprises two primary components, a hyperprior network and an autoregressive network. To effectively reduce structural redundancy across attributes, we apply a progressive coding algorithm to generate hyperprior features, in which we use previously compressed attributes and location as prior information. In particular, to better extract the location features from these compressed attributes, we adopt a domain-aware and instance-aware architecture to respectively capture domain-aware structural relations without additional storage costs and reveal scene-specific features through MLPs. Additionally, to reduce redundancy within each attribute, we leverage relationships between neighboring compressed elements within the attributes through an autoregressive network. Given its unique structure, we propose an adaptive context coding algorithm with flexible receptive fields to effectively capture adjacent compressed elements. Overall, we integrate our HEMGS into an end-to-end optimized 3DGS compression framework and the extensive experimental results on four benchmarks indicate that our method achieves about 40\\% average reduction in size while maintaining the rendering quality over our baseline method and achieving state-of-the-art compression results.",

We introduce a novel method for this task using 3D Gaussian Splatting, which enables intuitive scene editing through mesh adjustments. Starting with input images and camera poses, we reconstruct the underlying geometry using a neural Signed Distance Field and extract a high-quality mesh. Our model then estimates a set of Gaussians, where each component is flat, and the opacity is conditioned on the recovered neural surface. To facilitate editing, we produce a proxy representation that encodes information about the Gaussians' shape and position. Unlike other methods, our pipeline allows modifications applied to the extracted mesh to be propagated to the proxy representation, from which we recover the updated parameters of the Gaussians. This effectively transfers the mesh edits back to the recovered appearance representation. By leveraging mesh-guided transformations, our approach simplifies 3D scene editing and offers improvements over existing methods in terms of usability and visual fidelity of edits.

Additionally, we employ a coarse-to-fine representation and a structure-aware modeling strategy to ensure both accuracy and robustness, even for characters with non-standard skeleton structures.

In this paper, a novel generalizable Gaussian Splatting method, SmileSplat, is proposed to reconstruct pixel-aligned Gaussian surfels for diverse scenarios only requiring unconstrained sparse multi-view images. First, Gaussian surfels are predicted based on the multi-head Gaussian regression decoder, which can are represented with less degree-of-freedom but have better multi-view consistency. Furthermore, the normal vectors of Gaussian surfel are enhanced based on high-quality of normal priors. Second, the Gaussians and camera parameters (both extrinsic and intrinsic) are optimized to obtain high-quality Gaussian radiance fields for novel view synthesis tasks based on the proposed Bundle-Adjusting Gaussian Splatting module. Extensive experiments on novel view rendering and depth map prediction tasks are conducted on public datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in various 3D vision tasks.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieve remarkable visual quality. While 3DGS and its variants can be rendered efficiently using rasterization, many tasks require access to the underlying 3D surface, which remains challenging to extract due to the sparse and explicit nature of this representation. In this paper, we introduce G2SDF, a novel approach that addresses this limitation by integrating a neural implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF) into the Gaussian Splatting framework. Our method links the opacity values of Gaussians with their distances to the surface, ensuring a closer alignment of Gaussians with the scene surface. To extend this approach to unbounded scenes at varying scales, we propose a normalization function that maps any range to a fixed interval. To further enhance reconstruction quality, we leverage an off-the-shelf depth estimator as pseudo ground truth during Gaussian Splatting optimization. By establishing a differentiable connection between the explicit Gaussians and the implicit SDF, our approach enables high-quality surface reconstruction and rendering. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that G2SDF achieves superior reconstruction quality than prior works while maintaining the efficiency of 3DGS.",

    "abstract": "We present PreF3R, Pose-Free Feed-forward 3D Reconstruction from an image sequence of variable length. Unlike previous approaches, PreF3R removes the need for camera calibration and reconstructs the 3D Gaussian field within a canonical coordinate frame directly from a sequence of unposed images, enabling efficient novel-view rendering. We leverage DUSt3R's ability for pair-wise 3D structure reconstruction, and extend it to sequential multi-view input via a spatial memory network, eliminating the need for optimization-based global alignment. Additionally, PreF3R incorporates a dense Gaussian parameter prediction head, which enables subsequent novel-view synthesis with differentiable rasterization. This allows supervising our model with the combination of photometric loss and pointmap regression loss, enhancing both photorealism and structural accuracy. Given a sequence of ordered images, PreF3R incrementally reconstructs the 3D Gaussian field at 20 FPS, therefore enabling real-time novel-view rendering. Empirical experiments demonstrate that PreF3R is an effective solution for the challenging task of pose-free feed-forward novel-view synthesis, while also exhibiting robust generalization to unseen scenes.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the safety of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, requires extensive testing across diverse driving scenarios. Simulation is a key ingredient for conducting such testing in a cost-effective and scalable way. Neural rendering methods have gained popularity, as they can build simulation environments from collected logs in a data-driven manner. However, existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods for sensor-realistic rendering of camera and lidar data suffer from low rendering speeds, limiting their applicability for large-scale testing. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering, current methods are limited to camera data and are unable to render lidar data essential for autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose SplatAD, the first 3DGS-based method for realistic, real-time rendering of dynamic scenes for both camera and lidar data. SplatAD accurately models key sensor-specific phenomena such as rolling shutter effects, lidar intensity, and lidar ray dropouts, using purpose-built algorithms to optimize rendering efficiency. Evaluation across three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that SplatAD achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with up to +2 PSNR for NVS and +3 PSNR for reconstruction while increasing rendering speed over NeRF-based methods by an order of magnitude.

    "abstract": "Text-based generation and editing of 3D scenes hold significant potential for streamlining content creation through intuitive user interactions. While recent advances leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity and real-time rendering, existing methods are often specialized and task-focused, lacking a unified framework for both generation and editing. In this paper, we introduce SplatFlow, a comprehensive framework that addresses this gap by enabling direct 3DGS generation and editing. SplatFlow comprises two main components: a multi-view rectified flow (RF) model and a Gaussian Splatting Decoder (GSDecoder). The multi-view RF model operates in latent space, generating multi-view images, depths, and camera poses simultaneously, conditioned on text prompts, thus addressing challenges like diverse scene scales and complex camera trajectories in real-world settings. Then, the GSDecoder efficiently translates these latent outputs into 3DGS representations through a feed-forward 3DGS method. Leveraging training-free inversion and inpainting techniques, SplatFlow enables seamless 3DGS editing and supports a broad range of 3D tasks-including object editing, novel view synthesis, and camera pose estimation-within a unified framework without requiring additional complex pipelines. We validate SplatFlow's capabilities on the MVImgNet and DL3DV-7K datasets, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in various 3D generation, editing, and inpainting-based tasks.",

To address 3DGS's limitations in surface representation, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) introduced disks as scene primitives to model and reconstruct geometries from multi-view images, offering view-consistent geometry. However, the disk's first-order linear approximation often leads to over-smoothed results. We propose Quadratic Gaussian Splatting (QGS), a novel method that replaces disks with quadric surfaces, enhancing geometric fitting, whose code will be open-sourced. QGS defines Gaussian distributions in non-Euclidean space, allowing primitives to capture more complex textures. As a second-order surface approximation, QGS also renders spatial curvature to guide the normal consistency term, to effectively reduce over-smoothing. Moreover, QGS is a generalized version of 2DGS that achieves more accurate and detailed reconstructions, as verified by experiments on DTU and TNT, demonstrating its effectiveness in surpassing current state-of-the-art methods in geometry reconstruction.

In contrast, we propose a rigidly deformable 3D Gaussian-based scene representation that dramatically speeds up the system. However, improving tracking accuracy and reconstructing a globally consistent map from multiple agents remains challenging due to trajectory drift and discrepancies across agents' observations. Therefore, we propose new tracking and map-merging mechanisms and integrate loop closure in the Gaussian-based SLAM pipeline.

To address this, we introduce the first approach combining event cameras, which capture high-temporal-resolution, continuous motion data, with deformable 3D-GS for fast dynamic scene reconstruction. We observe that threshold modeling for events plays a crucial role in achieving high-quality reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a GS-Threshold Joint Modeling (GTJM) strategy, creating a mutually reinforcing process that greatly improves both 3D reconstruction and threshold modeling. Moreover, we introduce a Dynamic-Static Decomposition (DSD) strategy that first identifies dynamic areas by exploiting the inability of static Gaussians to represent motions, then applies a buffer-based soft decomposition to separate dynamic and static areas. This strategy accelerates rendering by avoiding unnecessary deformation in static areas, and focuses on dynamic areas to enhance fidelity. Our approach achieves high-fidelity dynamic reconstruction at 156 FPS with a 400$\\times$400 resolution on an RTX 3090 GPU.",

Recent works leverage feed-forward networks to generate pixel-aligned Gaussians, which could be fast rendered. Unfortunately, the method was unable to produce satisfactory results for areas not covered by the input images due to the formulation of these methods. In contrast, we leverage the novel view denoising through a transformer-based network to generate 3D Gaussians. Specifically, by incorporating both conditional views and noisy target views, the network predicts pixel-aligned Gaussians for each view. During training, the rendered target and some additional views of the Gaussians are supervised. During inference, the target views are iteratively rendered and denoised from pure noise. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in addressing the multi-view image reconstruction challenge. Due to generative modeling of unseen regions, NovelGS effectively reconstructs 3D objects with consistent and sharp textures. Experimental results on publicly available datasets indicate that NovelGS substantially surpasses existing image-to-3D frameworks, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also demonstrate the potential of NovelGS in generative tasks, such as text-to-3D and image-to-3D, by integrating it with existing multiview diffusion models.

Specifically, we design a sequential conditioning framework for the non-rigid warping of the human body, under whose guidance more accurate 3D Gaussians can be obtained in the observation space. Moreover, the explicit properties of Gaussians allow us to embed richer sequential information, encompassing both the coarse sequence of human poses and finer per-vertex motion details. These sequence conditions are further sampled across different temporal scales, in a coarse-to-fine manner, ensuring unbiased inputs for non-rigid warping. Experimental results demonstrate that our method combined with hierarchical spatio-temporal modeling surpasses concurrent baselines, delivering both high-quality rendering and flexible animating capabilities.",

In contrast to navigation in discrete environments with predefined trajectories, VLN in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents greater challenges, as the agent is free to navigate any unobstructed location and is more vulnerable to visual occlusions or blind spots. Recent approaches have attempted to address this by imagining future environments, either through predicted future visual images or semantic features, rather than relying solely on current observations. However, these RGB-based and feature-based methods lack intuitive appearance-level information or high-level semantic complexity crucial for effective navigation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable 3DGS-based pre-training paradigm, called UnitedVLN, which enables agents to better explore future environments by unitedly rendering high-fidelity 360 visual images and semantic features. UnitedVLN employs two key schemes: search-then-query sampling and separate-then-united rendering, which facilitate efficient exploitation of neural primitives, helping to integrate both appearance and semantic information for more robust navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnitedVLN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on existing VLN-CE benchmarks.",

Many methods directly filter out dynamic objects, resulting in incomplete scene reconstruction and limited accuracy of camera localization.

To overcome the above limitations, we propose a photo-realistic and geometry-aware RGB-D SLAM method by extending Gaussian splatting. Our method is composed of three main modules to 1) map the dynamic foreground including non-rigid humans and rigid items, 2) reconstruct the static background, and 3) localize the camera. To map the foreground, we focus on modeling the deformations and/or motions. We consider the shape priors of humans and exploit geometric and appearance constraints of humans and items. For background mapping, we design an optimization strategy between neighboring local maps by integrating appearance constraint into geometric alignment. As to camera localization, we leverage both static background and dynamic foreground to increase the observations for noise compensation. We explore the geometric and appearance constraints by associating 3D Gaussians with 2D optical flows and pixel patches. Experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of camera localization and scene representation.

However, the pre-requisite of running Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to get camera poses limits their completeness. While previous methods can reconstruct from a few unposed images, they are not applicable when images are unordered or densely captured. In this work, we propose ZeroGS to train 3DGS from hundreds of unposed and unordered images. Our method leverages a pretrained foundation model as the neural scene representation. Since the accuracy of the predicted pointmaps does not suffice for accurate image registration and high-fidelity image rendering, we propose to mitigate the issue by initializing and finetuning the pretrained model from a seed image. Images are then progressively registered and added to the training buffer, which is further used to train the model. We also propose to refine the camera poses and pointmaps by minimizing a point-to-camera ray consistency loss across multiple views. Experiments on the LLFF dataset, the MipNeRF360 dataset, and the Tanks-and-Temples dataset show that our method recovers more accurate camera poses than state-of-the-art pose-free NeRF/3DGS methods, and even renders higher quality images than 3DGS with COLMAP poses.

In this study, we attempt to explore deriving sharp intrinsic 3D human Gaussian avatars from blurry video footage in an end-to-end manner. Our approach encompasses a 3D-aware, physics-oriented model of blur formation attributable to human movement, coupled with a 3D human motion model to clarify ambiguities found in motion-induced blurry images. This methodology facilitates the concurrent learning of avatar model parameters and the refinement of sub-frame motion parameters from a coarse initialization. We have established benchmarks for this task through a synthetic dataset derived from existing multi-view captures, alongside a real-captured dataset acquired through a 360-degree synchronous hybrid-exposure camera system. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our model surpasses existing baselines.",

However, existing methods often suffer from facial distortions, inaccurate head movements, and limited fine-grained editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present DynamicAvatars, a dynamic model that generates photorealistic, moving 3D head avatars from video clips and parameters associated with facial positions and expressions. Our approach enables precise editing through a novel prompt-based editing model, which integrates user-provided prompts with guiding parameters derived from large language models (LLMs). To achieve this, we propose a dual-tracking framework based on Gaussian Splatting and introduce a prompt preprocessing module to enhance editing stability. By incorporating a specialized GAN algorithm and connecting it to our control module, which generates precise guiding parameters from LLMs, we successfully address the limitations of existing methods. Additionally, we develop a dynamic editing strategy that selectively utilizes specific training datasets to improve the efficiency and adaptability of the model for dynamic editing tasks.",

    "abstract": "Surface reconstruction from multi-view images is a core challenge in 3D vision. Recent studies have explored signed distance fields (SDF) within Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to achieve high-fidelity surface reconstructions. However, these approaches often suffer from slow training and rendering speeds compared to 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). Current state-of-the-art techniques attempt to fuse depth information to extract geometry from 3DGS, but frequently result in incomplete reconstructions and fragmented surfaces. In this paper, we introduce GSurf, a novel end-to-end method for learning a signed distance field directly from Gaussian primitives. The continuous and smooth nature of SDF addresses common issues in the 3DGS family, such as holes resulting from noisy or missing depth data. By using Gaussian splatting for rendering, GSurf avoids the redundant volume rendering typically required in other GS and SDF integrations. Consequently, GSurf achieves faster training and rendering speeds while delivering 3D reconstruction quality comparable to neural implicit surface methods, such as VolSDF and NeuS. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions.",

While recent methods based on 3D/4D Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated promising results, they still encounter challenges in complex street scenes due to the unpredictable motion of dynamic objects. Current methods typically decompose street scenes into static and dynamic objects, learning the Gaussians in either a supervised manner (e.g., w/ 3D bounding-box) or a self-supervised manner (e.g., w/o 3D bounding-box). However, these approaches do not effectively model the motions of dynamic objects (e.g., the motion speed of pedestrians is clearly different from that of vehicles), resulting in suboptimal scene decomposition. To address this, we propose Explicit Motion Decomposition (EMD), which models the motions of dynamic objects by introducing learnable motion embeddings to the Gaussians, enhancing the decomposition in street scenes. The proposed EMD is a plug-and-play approach applicable to various baseline methods. We also propose tailored training strategies to apply EMD to both supervised and self-supervised baselines. Through comprehensive experimentation, we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach with various established baselines.

SplatFlow designs a unified framework to seamlessly integrate time-dependent 4D Gaussian representation within NMFF, where NMFF is a set of implicit functions to model temporal motions of both LiDAR points and Gaussians as continuous motion flow fields. Leveraging NMFF, SplatFlow effectively decomposes static background and dynamic objects, representing them with 3D and 4D Gaussian primitives, respectively. NMFF also models the status correspondences of each 4D Gaussian across time, which aggregates temporal features to enhance cross-view consistency of dynamic components. SplatFlow further improves dynamic scene identification by distilling features from 2D foundational models into 4D space-time representation. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI Dataset validate SplatFlow's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for both image reconstruction and novel view synthesis in dynamic urban scenarios.",

However, 3DGS faces challenges in handling environmental disturbances from dynamic objects with irregular movement, leading to degradation in both camera tracking accuracy and map reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we develop an RGB-D dense SLAM which is called Gaussian Splatting SLAM in Dynamic Environments (Gassidy). This approach calculates Gaussians to generate rendering loss flows for each environmental component based on a designed photometric-geometric loss function. To distinguish and filter environmental disturbances, we iteratively analyze rendering loss flows to detect features characterized by changes in loss values between dynamic objects and static components. This process ensures a clean environment for accurate scene reconstruction. Compared to state-of-the-art SLAM methods, experimental results on open datasets show that Gassidy improves camera tracking precision by up to 97.9% and enhances map quality by up to 6%.",

    "abstract": "A signed distance function (SDF) is a useful representation for continuous-space geometry and many related operations, including rendering, collision checking, and mesh generation. Hence, reconstructing SDF from image observations accurately and efficiently is a fundamental problem. Recently, neural implicit SDF (SDF-NeRF) techniques, trained using volumetric rendering, have gained a lot of attention. Compared to earlier truncated SDF (TSDF) fusion algorithms that rely on depth maps and voxelize continuous space, SDF-NeRF enables continuous-space SDF reconstruction with better geometric and photometric accuracy. However, the accuracy and convergence speed of scene-level SDF reconstruction require further improvements for many applications. With the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as an explicit representation with excellent rendering quality and speed, several works have focused on improving SDF-NeRF by introducing consistency losses on depth and surface normals between 3DGS and SDF-NeRF. However, loss-level connections alone lead to incremental improvements. We propose a novel neural implicit SDF called \"SplatSDF\" to fuse 3DGSandSDF-NeRF at an architecture level with significant boosts to geometric and photometric accuracy and convergence speed. Our SplatSDF relies on 3DGS as input only during training, and keeps the same complexity and efficiency as the original SDF-NeRF during inference. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art SDF-NeRF models on geometric and photometric evaluation by the time of submission.",

Although existing methods have achieved photorealistic reconstruction, they mostly focus on pinhole cameras and neglect fisheye cameras. In fact, how to effectively simulate fisheye cameras in driving scene remains an unsolved problem. In this work, we propose UniGaussian, a novel approach that learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation from multiple camera models for urban scene reconstruction in autonomous driving. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a new differentiable rendering method that distorts 3D Gaussians using a series of affine transformations tailored to fisheye camera models. This addresses the compatibility issue of 3D Gaussian splatting with fisheye cameras, which is hindered by light ray distortion caused by lenses or mirrors. Besides, our method maintains real-time rendering while ensuring differentiability. Second, built on the differentiable rendering method, we design a new framework that learns a unified Gaussian representation from multiple camera models. By applying affine transformations to adapt different camera models and regularizing the shared Gaussians with supervision from different modalities, our framework learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation with input data from multiple sources and achieves holistic driving scene understanding. As a result, our approach models multiple sensors (pinhole and fisheye cameras) and modalities (depth, semantic, normal and LiDAR point clouds). Our experiments show that our method achieves superior rendering quality and fast rendering speed for driving scene simulation.",

We are interested in capturing 4D shapes whose topology changes largely over time. We encounter that the straightforward extension of the existing 3D-based method to the desired 4D case performs poorly.   In this work, we address the challenges in extending 3D neural evolution to 4D under large topological changes by proposing two novel modifications. More precisely, we introduce (i) a new architecture to discretize and encode the deformation and learn the SDF and (ii) a technique to impose the temporal consistency. (iii) Also, we propose a rendering scheme for color prediction based on Gaussian splatting. Furthermore, to facilitate learning directly from 2D images, we propose a learning framework that can disentangle the geometry and appearance from RGB images. This method of disentanglement, while also useful for the 4D evolution problem that we are concentrating on, is also novel and valid for static scenes. Our extensive experiments on various data provide awesome results and, most importantly, open a new approach toward reconstructing challenging scenes with significant topological changes and deformations.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in radiance field reconstruction, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have achieved high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering by representing scenes with compositions of Gaussian primitives. However, 3D Gaussians present several limitations for scene reconstruction. Accurately capturing hard edges is challenging without significantly increasing the number of Gaussians, creating a large memory footprint. Moreover, they struggle to represent flat surfaces, as they are diffused in space. Without hand-crafted regularizers, they tend to disperse irregularly around the actual surface. To circumvent these issues, we introduce a novel method, named 3D Convex Splatting (3DCS), which leverages 3D smooth convexes as primitives for modeling geometrically-meaningful radiance fields from multi-view images. Smooth convex shapes offer greater flexibility than Gaussians, allowing for a better representation of 3D scenes with hard edges and dense volumes using fewer primitives. Powered by our efficient CUDA-based rasterizer, 3DCS achieves superior performance over 3DGS on benchmarks such as Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep Blending. Specifically, our method attains an improvement of up to 0.81 in PSNR and 0.026 in LPIPS compared to 3DGS while maintaining high rendering speeds and reducing the number of required primitives. Our results highlight the potential of 3D Convex Splatting to become the new standard for high-quality scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Project page: convexsplatting.github.io.",

While existing approaches mainly rely on processing full-length multi-view videos for 4D reconstruction, there has been limited exploration of iterative online reconstruction methods that enable on-the-fly training and per-frame streaming. Current 3DGS-based streaming methods treat the Gaussian primitives uniformly and constantly renew the densified Gaussians, thereby overlooking the difference between dynamic and static features and also neglecting the temporal continuity in the scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage pipeline for iterative streamable 4D dynamic spatial reconstruction. Our pipeline comprises a selective inheritance stage to preserve temporal continuity, a dynamics-aware shift stage for distinguishing dynamic and static primitives and optimizing their movements, and an error-guided densification stage to accommodate emerging objects.

Specifically, we introduce a self-supervised method for voxel velocity estimation. By warping voxels to adjacent frames and supervising the rendered outputs, the model effectively learns motion cues in the sequential data. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-frame photometric consistency approach to enhance geometric perception. It projects adjacent frames to the current frame based on rendered depths and relative poses, boosting the 3D geometric representation through pure image supervision.

    "abstract": "Existing feed-forward image-to-3D methods mainly rely on 2D multi-view diffusion models that cannot guarantee 3D consistency. These methods easily collapse when changing the prompt view direction and mainly handle object-centric prompt images. In this paper, we propose a novel single-stage 3D diffusion model, DiffusionGS, for object and scene generation from a single view. DiffusionGS directly outputs 3D Gaussian point clouds at each timestep to enforce view consistency and allow the model to generate robustly given prompt views of any directions, beyond object-centric inputs. Plus, to improve the capability and generalization ability of DiffusionGS, we scale up 3D training data by developing a scene-object mixed training strategy. Experiments show that our method enjoys better generation quality (2.20 dB higher in PSNR and 23.25 lower in FID) and over 5x faster speed (~6s on an A100 GPU) than SOTA methods. The user study and text-to-3D applications also reveals the practical values of our method. Our Project page at https://caiyuanhao1998.github.io/project/DiffusionGS/ shows the video and interactive generation results.",

In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods",

    "abstract": "While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated remarkable rendering quality and efficiency in 3D scene reconstruction, it struggles with varying lighting conditions and incidental occlusions in real-world scenarios. To accommodate varying lighting conditions, existing 3DGS extensions apply color mapping to the massive Gaussian primitives with individually optimized appearance embeddings. To handle occlusions, they predict pixel-wise uncertainties via 2D image features for occlusion capture. Nevertheless, such massive color mapping and pixel-wise uncertainty prediction strategies suffer from not only additional computational costs but also coarse-grained lighting and occlusion handling. In this work, we propose a nexus kernel-driven approach, termed NexusSplats, for efficient and finer 3D scene reconstruction under complex lighting and occlusion conditions. In particular, NexusSplats leverages a novel light decoupling strategy where appearance embeddings are optimized based on nexus kernels instead of massive Gaussian primitives, thus accelerating reconstruction speeds while ensuring local color consistency for finer textures. Additionally, a Gaussian-wise uncertainty mechanism is developed, aligning 3D structures with 2D image features for fine-grained occlusion handling. Experimental results demonstrate that NexusSplats achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing reconstruction time by up to 70.4% compared to the current best in quality.",

    "abstract": "We present FAST-Splat for fast, ambiguity-free semantic Gaussian Splatting, which seeks to address the main limitations of existing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods, namely: slow training and rendering speeds; high memory usage; and ambiguous semantic object localization. In deriving FAST-Splat , we formulate open-vocabulary semantic Gaussian Splatting as the problem of extending closed-set semantic distillation to the open-set (open-vocabulary) setting, enabling FAST-Splat to provide precise semantic object localization results, even when prompted with ambiguous user-provided natural-language queries. Further, by exploiting the explicit form of the Gaussian Splatting scene representation to the fullest extent, FAST-Splat retains the remarkable training and rendering speeds of Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, while existing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods distill semantics into a separate neural field or utilize neural models for dimensionality reduction, FAST-Splat directly augments each Gaussian with specific semantic codes, preserving the training, rendering, and memory-usage advantages of Gaussian Splatting over neural field methods. These Gaussian-specific semantic codes, together with a hash-table, enable semantic similarity to be measured with open-vocabulary user prompts and further enable FAST-Splat to respond with unambiguous semantic object labels and 3D masks, unlike prior methods. In experiments, we demonstrate that FAST-Splat is 4x to 6x faster to train with a 13x faster data pre-processing step, achieves between 18x to 75x faster rendering speeds, and requires about 3x smaller GPU memory, compared to the best-competing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods. Further, FAST-Splat achieves relatively similar or better semantic segmentation performance compared to existing methods.

However, existing video models such as Luma Dream Machine fail at this task. We design a self-supervised method that takes advantage of the consistency of videos and variability of multiview internet photos to train a scalable, 3D-aware video model without any 3D annotations such as camera parameters. We validate that our method outperforms all baselines in terms of geometric and appearance consistency.

To address this problem, recent methods use neural radiance fields (NeRF) to generate augmented data.

While 3DGS has been extensively examined in head avatars, it faces challenges with accurate gaze control and generalization across different subjects. In this work, we propose GazeGaussian, a high-fidelity gaze redirection method that uses a two-stream 3DGS model to represent the face and eye regions separately. By leveraging the unstructured nature of 3DGS, we develop a novel eye representation for rigid eye rotation based on the target gaze direction. To enhance synthesis generalization across various subjects, we integrate an expression-conditional module to guide the neural renderer. Comprehensive experiments show that GazeGaussian outperforms existing methods in rendering speed, gaze redirection accuracy, and facial synthesis across multiple datasets. We also demonstrate that existing gaze estimation methods can leverage GazeGaussian to improve their generalization performance.

    "abstract": "Existing approaches to drone visual geo-localization predominantly adopt the image-based setting, where a single drone-view snapshot is matched with images from other platforms. Such task formulation, however, underutilizes the inherent video output of the drone and is sensitive to occlusions and environmental constraints. To address these limitations, we formulate a new video-based drone geo-localization task and propose the Video2BEV paradigm. This paradigm transforms the video into a Bird's Eye View (BEV), simplifying the subsequent matching process. In particular, we employ Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct a 3D scene and obtain the BEV projection. Different from the existing transform methods, \\eg, polar transform, our BEVs preserve more fine-grained details without significant distortion. To further improve model scalability toward diverse BEVs and satellite figures, our Video2BEV paradigm also incorporates a diffusion-based module for generating hard negative samples, which facilitates discriminative feature learning. To validate our approach, we introduce UniV, a new video-based geo-localization dataset that extends the image-based University-1652 dataset. UniV features flight paths at $30^\\circ$ and $45^\\circ$ elevation angles with increased frame rates of up to 10 frames per second (FPS). Extensive experiments on the UniV dataset show that our Video2BEV paradigm achieves competitive recall rates and outperforms conventional video-based methods. Compared to other methods, our proposed approach exhibits robustness at lower elevations with more occlusions.",

Despite promising results, current deep learning-based and NeRF-based reconstruction methods face challenges: 1) deep learning-based reconstruction methods struggle to maintain 3D structural consistency within scenes, and 2) NeRF-based reconstruction methods still face limitations in handling dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we propose SCIGS, a variant of 3DGS, and develop a primitive-level transformation network that utilizes camera pose stamps and Gaussian primitive coordinates as embedding vectors. This approach resolves the necessity of camera pose in vanilla 3DGS and enhances multi-view 3D structural consistency in dynamic scenes by utilizing transformed primitives. Additionally, a high-frequency filter is introduced to eliminate the artifacts generated during the transformation. The proposed SCIGS is the first to reconstruct a 3D explicit scene from a single compressed image, extending its application to dynamic 3D scenes. Experiments on both static and dynamic scenes demonstrate that SCIGS not only enhances SCI decoding but also outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from a single compressed image.

Current methods address these issues by refining scene structure, enhancing geometric representations, addressing blur in training images, improving rendering consistency, and optimizing density control, yet the role of kernel design remains underexplored. We identify the soft boundaries of Gaussian ellipsoids as one of the causes of these artifacts, limiting detail capture in high-frequency regions. To bridge this gap, we introduce 3D Linear Splatting (3DLS), which replaces Gaussian kernels with linear kernels to achieve sharper and more precise results, particularly in high-frequency regions. Through evaluations on three datasets, 3DLS demonstrates state-of-the-art fidelity and accuracy, along with a 30% FPS improvement over baseline 3DGS.

    "abstract": "In this study, we explore the essential challenge of fast scene optimization for Gaussian Splatting. Through a thorough analysis of the geometry modeling process, we reveal that dense point clouds can be effectively reconstructed early in optimization through Gaussian representations. This insight leads to our approach of aggressive Gaussian densification, which provides a more efficient alternative to conventional progressive densification methods. By significantly increasing the number of critical Gaussians, we enhance the model capacity to capture dense scene geometry at the early stage of optimization. This strategy is seamlessly integrated into the Mini-Splatting densification and simplification framework, enabling rapid convergence without compromising quality. Additionally, we introduce visibility culling within Gaussian Splatting, leveraging per-view Gaussian importance as precomputed visibility to accelerate the optimization process. Our Mini-Splatting2 achieves a balanced trade-off among optimization time, the number of Gaussians, and rendering quality, establishing a strong baseline for future Gaussian-Splatting-based works. Our work sets the stage for more efficient, high-quality 3D scene modeling in real-world applications, and the code will be made available no matter acceptance.",

Notably, LiV-GS is the first method that directly aligns discrete and sparse LiDAR data with continuous differentiable Gaussian maps in large-scale outdoor scenes, overcoming the limitation of fixed resolution in traditional LiDAR mapping. The system aligns point clouds with Gaussian maps using shared covariance attributes for front-end tracking and integrates the normal orientation into the loss function to refines the Gaussian map. To reliably and stably update Gaussians outside the LiDAR field of view, we introduce a novel conditional Gaussian constraint that aligns these Gaussians closely with the nearest reliable ones. The targeted adjustment enables LiV-GS to achieve fast and accurate mapping with novel view synthesis at a rate of 7.98 FPS. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate LiV-GS's superior performance in SLAM, image rendering and mapping. The successful cross-modal radar-LiDAR localization highlights the potential of LiV-GS for applications in cross-modal semantic positioning and object segmentation with Gaussian maps.",

In this work, we present a novel sketch-guided 3D GS deformation system that allows users to intuitively modify the geometry of a 3D GS model by drawing a silhouette sketch from a single viewpoint. Our approach introduces a new deformation method that combines cage-based deformations with a variant of Neural Jacobian Fields, enabling precise, fine-grained control.

    "abstract": "In the real world, objects reveal internal textures when sliced or cut, yet this behavior is not well-studied in 3D generation tasks today. For example, slicing a virtual 3D watermelon should reveal flesh and seeds. Given that no available dataset captures an object's full internal structure and collecting data from all slices is impractical, generative methods become the obvious approach. However, current 3D generation and inpainting methods often focus on visible appearance and overlook internal textures. To bridge this gap, we introduce FruitNinja, the first method to generate internal textures for 3D objects undergoing geometric and topological changes. Our approach produces objects via 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with both surface and interior textures synthesized, enabling real-time slicing and rendering without additional optimization. FruitNinja leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to progressively inpaint cross-sectional views and applies voxel-grid-based smoothing to achieve cohesive textures throughout the object. Our OpaqueAtom GS strategy overcomes 3DGS limitations by employing densely distributed opaque Gaussians, avoiding biases toward larger particles that destabilize training and sharp color transitions for fine-grained textures. Experimental results show that FruitNinja substantially outperforms existing approaches, showcasing unmatched visual quality in real-time rendered internal views across arbitrary geometry manipulations.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Recent methods extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via additional deformation fields and apply explicit constraints like motion flow to guide the deformation. However, they learn motion changes from individual timestamps independently, making it challenging to reconstruct complex scenes, particularly when dealing with violent movement, extreme-shaped geometries, or reflective surfaces. To address the above issue, we design a plug-and-play module called TimeFormer to enable existing deformable 3D Gaussians reconstruction methods with the ability to implicitly model motion patterns from a learning perspective. Specifically, TimeFormer includes a Cross-Temporal Transformer Encoder, which adaptively learns the temporal relationships of deformable 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we propose a two-stream optimization strategy that transfers the motion knowledge learned from TimeFormer to the base stream during the training phase. This allows us to remove TimeFormer during inference, thereby preserving the original rendering speed. Extensive experiments in the multi-view and monocular dynamic scenes validate qualitative and quantitative improvement brought by TimeFormer. Project Page: https://patrickddj.github.io/TimeFormer/",

To this end, we introduce Gaussian parameter maps defined on the source views and directly regress Gaussian properties for instant novel view synthesis without any fine-tuning or optimization. We train our Gaussian parameter regression module on human-only data or human-scene data, jointly with a depth estimation module to lift 2D parameter maps to 3D space. The proposed framework is fully differentiable with both depth and rendering supervision or with only rendering supervision. We further introduce a regularization term and an epipolar attention mechanism to preserve geometry consistency between two source views, especially when neglecting depth supervision.

Our approach employs a two-stage optimization pipeline of dynamic street Gaussians. In the first stage, we extract 2D motion masks based on the observation that 3D Gaussian Splatting inherently can reconstruct only the static regions in dynamic environments. These extracted 2D motion priors are then mapped into the Gaussian space in a differentiable manner, leveraging an efficient formulation of dynamic Gaussians in the second stage. Combined with the introduced geometric regularizations, our method are able to address the over-fitting issues caused by data sparsity in autonomous driving, reconstructing physically plausible Gaussians that align with object surfaces rather than floating in air. Furthermore, we introduce temporal cross-view consistency to ensure coherence across time and viewpoints, resulting in high-quality surface reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of DeSiRe-GS, surpassing prior self-supervised arts and achieving accuracy comparable to methods relying on external 3D bounding box annotations.

In the context of video data, such models can be utilized to transform the coordinates of pixel locations along with frame occurrence times (or indices) into RGB color values. Although INRs facilitate effective compression, they are unsuitable for editing purposes. One potential solution is to use a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based model, such as the Video Gaussian Representation (VGR), which is capable of encoding video as a multitude of 3D Gaussians and is applicable for numerous video processing operations, including editing. Nevertheless, in this case, the capacity for modification is constrained to a limited set of basic transformations. To address this issue, we introduce the Video Gaussian Splatting (VeGaS) model, which enables realistic modifications of video data. To construct VeGaS, we propose a novel family of Folded-Gaussian distributions designed to capture nonlinear dynamics in a video stream and model consecutive frames by 2D Gaussians obtained as respective conditional distributions. Our experiments demonstrate that VeGaS outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in frame reconstruction tasks and allows realistic modifications of video data.

To address these challenges, we integrate Gaussian Splatting SLAM with a robust filtering process to handle dynamic objects throughout the entire pipeline, including Gaussian insertion and keyframe selection. Within this framework, to further improve the accuracy of dynamic object removal, we introduce a robust mask generation method that enforces photometric consistency across keyframes, reducing noise from inaccurate segmentation and artifacts such as shadows. Additionally, we propose the loop-aware window selection mechanism, which utilizes unique keyframe IDs of 3D Gaussians to detect loops between the current and past frames, facilitating joint optimization of the current camera poses and the Gaussian map. DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both camera tracking and novel view synthesis on various dynamic SLAM benchmarks, proving its effectiveness in handling real-world dynamic scenes.",

In this work, we present SPARS3R, which combines the advantages of accurate pose estimation from Structure-from-Motion and dense point cloud from depth estimation. To this end, SPARS3R first performs a Global Fusion Alignment process that maps a prior dense point cloud to a sparse point cloud from Structure-from-Motion based on triangulated correspondences. RANSAC is applied during this process to distinguish inliers and outliers. SPARS3R then performs a second, Semantic Outlier Alignment step, which extracts semantically coherent regions around the outliers and performs local alignment in these regions.

The perception unit includes three synchronised global shutter colour cameras, an automotive 3D LiDAR scanner, and an inertial sensor - all precisely calibrated. We also establish benchmarks for tasks involving localisation, reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis, which enable the evaluation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) methods, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-view Stereo (MVS) methods as well as radiance field methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting. To evaluate 3D reconstruction the TLS 3D models are used as ground truth. Localisation ground truth is computed by registering the mobile LiDAR scans to the TLS 3D models. Radiance field methods are evaluated not only with poses sampled from the input trajectory, but also from viewpoints that are from trajectories which are distant from the training poses. Our evaluation demonstrates a key limitation of state-of-the-art radiance field methods: we show that they tend to overfit to the training poses/images and do not generalise well to out-of-sequence poses. They also underperform in 3D reconstruction compared to MVS systems using the same visual inputs. Our dataset and benchmarks are intended to facilitate better integration of radiance field methods and SLAM systems.

    "abstract": "Spike cameras, as an innovative neuromorphic camera that captures scenes with the 0-1 bit stream at 40 kHz, are increasingly employed for the 3D reconstruction task via Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Previous spike-based 3D reconstruction approaches often employ a casecased pipeline: starting with high-quality image reconstruction from spike streams based on established spike-to-image reconstruction algorithms, then progressing to camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, this cascaded approach suffers from substantial cumulative errors, where quality limitations of initial image reconstructions negatively impact pose estimation, ultimately degrading the fidelity of the 3D reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a synergistic optimization framework, \\textbf{USP-Gaussian}, that unifies spike-based image reconstruction, pose correction, and Gaussian splatting into an end-to-end framework. Leveraging the multi-view consistency afforded by 3DGS and the motion capture capability of the spike camera, our framework enables a joint iterative optimization that seamlessly integrates information between the spike-to-image network and 3DGS. Experiments on synthetic datasets with accurate poses demonstrate that our method surpasses previous approaches by effectively eliminating cascading errors. Moreover, we integrate pose optimization to achieve robust 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios with inaccurate initial poses, outperforming alternative methods by effectively reducing noise and preserving fine texture details.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in novel view synthesis, balancing advanced rendering quality with real-time performance. However, in trained scenes, a large number of Gaussians with low opacity significantly increase rendering costs. This issue arises due to flaws in the split and clone operations during the densification process, which lead to extensive Gaussian overlap and subsequent opacity reduction. To enhance the efficiency of Gaussian utilization, we improve the adaptive density control of 3DGS. First, we introduce a more efficient long-axis split operation to replace the original clone and split, which mitigates Gaussian overlap and improves densification efficiency.Second, we propose a simple adaptive pruning technique to reduce the number of low-opacity Gaussians. Finally, by dynamically lowering the splitting threshold and applying importance weighting, the efficiency of Gaussian utilization is further improved. We evaluate our proposed method on various challenging real-world datasets. Experimental results show that our Efficient Density Control (EDC) can enhance both the rendering speed and quality.

However, the implicit encoding of geometric and textural information poses challenges in accurately locating and controlling objects during editing. Recently, significant advancements have been made in the editing methods of 3D Gaussian Splatting, a real-time rendering technology that relies on explicit representation. However, these methods still suffer from issues including inaccurate localization and limited manipulation over editing. To tackle these challenges, we propose GSEditPro, a novel 3D scene editing framework which allows users to perform various creative and precise editing using text prompts only.

    "abstract": "Differentiable rendering methods have emerged as a promising means for generating photo-realistic and physically plausible adversarial attacks by manipulating 3D objects and scenes that can deceive deep neural networks (DNNs). Recently, differentiable rendering capabilities have evolved significantly into a diverse landscape of libraries, such as Mitsuba, PyTorch3D, and methods like Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting for solving inverse rendering problems that share conceptually similar properties commonly used to attack DNNs, such as back-propagation and optimization. However, the adversarial machine learning research community has not yet fully explored or understood such capabilities for generating attacks. Some key reasons are that researchers often have different attack goals, such as misclassification or misdetection, and use different tasks to accomplish these goals by manipulating different representation in a scene, such as the mesh or texture of an object. This survey adopts a task-oriented unifying framework that systematically summarizes common tasks, such as manipulating textures, altering illumination, and modifying 3D meshes to exploit vulnerabilities in DNNs. Our framework enables easy comparison of existing works, reveals research gaps and spotlights exciting future research directions in this rapidly evolving field. Through focusing on how these tasks enable attacks on various DNNs such as image classification, facial recognition, object detection, optical flow and depth estimation, our survey helps researchers and practitioners better understand the vulnerabilities of computer vision systems against photorealistic adversarial attacks that could threaten real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which lead to high-quality novel view synthesis and accelerated rendering, have remarkably improved the quality of radiance field reconstruction. However, the extraction of mesh from a massive number of minute 3D Gaussian points remains great challenge due to the large volume of Gaussians and difficulty of representation of sharp signals caused by their inherent low-pass characteristics. To address this issue, we propose DyGASR, which utilizes generalized exponential function instead of traditional 3D Gaussian to decrease the number of particles and dynamically optimize the representation of the captured signal. In addition, it is observed that reconstructing mesh with Generalized Exponential Splatting(GES) without modifications frequently leads to failures since the generalized exponential distribution centroids may not precisely align with the scene surface. To overcome this, we adopt Sugar's approach and introduce Generalized Surface Regularization (GSR), which reduces the smallest scaling vector of each point cloud to zero and ensures normal alignment perpendicular to the surface, facilitating subsequent Poisson surface mesh reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a dynamic resolution adjustment strategy that utilizes a cosine schedule to gradually increase image resolution from low to high during the training stage, thus avoiding constant full resolution, which significantly boosts the reconstruction speed. Our approach surpasses existing 3DGS-based mesh reconstruction methods, as evidenced by extensive evaluations on various scene datasets, demonstrating a 25\\% increase in speed, and a 30\\% reduction in memory usage.",

This approach improves both the performance of novel view synthesis and the quality of training image reconstruction. We also identify the initialization problem of 4DGS in fast-moving dynamic regions, where the Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm fails to provide reliable 3D landmarks. To initialize Gaussian primitives in such regions, we present a dynamic region densification method using the estimated depth maps and scene flow. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves the performance of 4DGS reconstruction from a video captured by a handheld monocular camera and also exhibits promising results in few-shot static scene reconstruction.",

Our method's qualitative and quantitative improvements over 3D and 2D Gaussians are most noticeable when fewer primitives are used, when BBSplat achieves over 1200 FPS. Our novel regularization term encourages textures to have a sparser structure, unlocking an efficient compression that leads to a reduction in storage space of the model. Our experiments show the efficiency of BBSplat on standard datasets of real indoor and outdoor scenes such as Tanks&Temples, DTU, and Mip-NeRF-360. We demonstrate improvements on PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics compared to the state-of-the-art, especially for the case when fewer primitives are used, which, on the other hand, leads to up to 2 times inference speed improvement for the same rendering quality.",

While UAV-based imaging has advanced high-throughput phenotyping, current methods often rely on orthophoto images, which struggle with overlapping leaves and incomplete structural information in complex field environments. This study integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise 3D reconstruction and biomass estimation of oilseed rape. UAV multi-view oblique images from 36 angles were used to perform 3D reconstruction, with the SAM module enhancing point cloud segmentation. The segmented point clouds were then converted into point cloud volumes, which were fitted to ground-measured biomass using linear regression. The results showed that 3DGS (7k and 30k iterations) provided high accuracy, with peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNR) of 27.43 and 29.53 and training times of 7 and 49 minutes, respectively. This performance exceeded that of structure from motion (SfM) and mipmap Neural Radiance Fields (Mip-NeRF), demonstrating superior efficiency. The SAM module achieved high segmentation accuracy, with a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 0.961 and an F1-score of 0.980. Additionally, a comparison of biomass extraction models found the point cloud volume model to be the most accurate, with an determination coefficient (R2) of 0.976, root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.92 g/plant, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.81%, outperforming both the plot crop volume and individual crop volume models.

However, during the rendering process, the use of the Jacobian of the affine approximation of the projection transformation leads to inevitable errors, resulting in blurriness, artifacts and a lack of scene consistency in the final rendered images. To address this issue, we introduce an ellipsoid-based projection method to calculate the projection of Gaussian ellipsoid onto the image plane, which is the primitive of 3D Gaussian Splatting. As our proposed ellipsoid-based projection method cannot handle Gaussian ellipsoids with camera origins inside them or parts lying below $z=0$ plane in the camera space, we designed a pre-filtering strategy. Experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmark datasets show that our ellipsoid-based projection method can enhance the rendering quality of 3D Gaussian Splatting and its extensions.",

    "abstract": "We introduce GaussianCut, a new method for interactive multiview segmentation of scenes represented as 3D Gaussians. Our approach allows for selecting the objects to be segmented by interacting with a single view. It accepts intuitive user input, such as point clicks, coarse scribbles, or text. Using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as the underlying scene representation simplifies the extraction of objects of interest which are considered to be a subset of the scene's Gaussians. Our key idea is to represent the scene as a graph and use the graph-cut algorithm to minimize an energy function to effectively partition the Gaussians into foreground and background. To achieve this, we construct a graph based on scene Gaussians and devise a segmentation-aligned energy function on the graph to combine user inputs with scene properties. To obtain an initial coarse segmentation, we leverage 2D image/video segmentation models and further refine these coarse estimates using our graph construction. Our empirical evaluations show the adaptability of GaussianCut across a diverse set of scenes. GaussianCut achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches for 3D segmentation without requiring any additional segmentation-aware training.",

    "abstract": "The online reconstruction of dynamic scenes from multi-view streaming videos faces significant challenges in training, rendering and storage efficiency. Harnessing superior learning speed and real-time rendering capabilities, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated considerable potential in this field. However, 3DGS can be inefficient in terms of storage and prone to overfitting by excessively growing Gaussians, particularly with limited views. This paper proposes an efficient framework, dubbed HiCoM, with three key components. First, we construct a compact and robust initial 3DGS representation using a perturbation smoothing strategy. Next, we introduce a Hierarchical Coherent Motion mechanism that leverages the inherent non-uniform distribution and local consistency of 3D Gaussians to swiftly and accurately learn motions across frames. Finally, we continually refine the 3DGS with additional Gaussians, which are later merged into the initial 3DGS to maintain consistency with the evolving scene. To preserve a compact representation, an equivalent number of low-opacity Gaussians that minimally impact the representation are removed before processing subsequent frames. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used datasets show that our framework improves learning efficiency of the state-of-the-art methods by about $20\\%$ and reduces the data storage by $85\\%$, achieving competitive free-viewpoint video synthesis quality but with higher robustness and stability. Moreover, by parallel learning multiple frames simultaneously, our HiCoM decreases the average training wall time to $<2$ seconds per frame with negligible performance degradation, substantially boosting real-world applicability and responsiveness.",

This paper starts by analyzing and comparing two prominent shading techniques popularly used for inverse rendering, forward shading and deferred shading, effectiveness in handling complex materials. More importantly, we propose a unified shading solution that combines the advantages of both techniques for better decomposition. In addition, we analyze the normal modeling in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and utilize the shortest axis as normal for each particle in GUS-IR, along with a depth-related regularization, resulting in improved geometric representation and better shape reconstruction. Furthermore, we enhance the probe-based baking scheme proposed by GS-IR to achieve more accurate ambient occlusion modeling to better handle indirect illumination.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) demonstrates excellent rendering quality and generation speed in novel view synthesis. However, substantial data size poses challenges for storage and transmission, making 3D GS compression an essential technology. Current 3D GS compression research primarily focuses on developing more compact scene representations, such as converting explicit 3D GS data into implicit forms. In contrast, compression of the GS data itself has hardly been explored. To address this gap, we propose a Hierarchical GS Compression (HGSC) technique. Initially, we prune unimportant Gaussians based on importance scores derived from both global and local significance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining visual quality. An Octree structure is used to compress 3D positions. Based on the 3D GS Octree, we implement a hierarchical attribute compression strategy by employing a KD-tree to partition the 3D GS into multiple blocks. We apply farthest point sampling to select anchor primitives within each block and others as non-anchor primitives with varying Levels of Details (LoDs). Anchor primitives serve as reference points for predicting non-anchor primitives across different LoDs to reduce spatial redundancy. For anchor primitives, we use the region adaptive hierarchical transform to achieve near-lossless compression of various attributes. For non-anchor primitives, each is predicted based on the k-nearest anchor primitives. To further minimize prediction errors, the reconstructed LoD and anchor primitives are combined to form new anchor primitives to predict the next LoD. Our method notably achieves superior compression quality and a significant data size reduction of over 4.5 times compared to the state-of-the-art compression method on small scenes datasets.",

Building on these advancements, early methods have been developed for dynamic surface reconstruction by globally optimizing entire sequences. However, reconstructing dynamic scenes with significant topology changes, emerging or disappearing objects, and rapid movements remains a substantial challenge, particularly for long sequences. To address these issues, we propose AT-GS, a novel method for reconstructing high-quality dynamic surfaces from multi-view videos through per-frame incremental optimization. To avoid local minima across frames, we introduce a unified and adaptive gradient-aware densification strategy that integrates the strengths of conventional cloning and splitting techniques. Additionally, we reduce temporal jittering in dynamic surfaces by ensuring consistency in curvature maps across consecutive frames. Our method achieves superior accuracy and temporal coherence in dynamic surface reconstruction, delivering high-fidelity space-time novel view synthesis, even in complex and challenging scenes.

However, rendering quality significantly deteriorates when test views deviate from the camera angles used during training, posing a major challenge for applications in immersive free-viewpoint rendering and navigation. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 3DGS and related novel view synthesis methods under out-of-distribution (OOD) test camera scenarios. By creating diverse test cases with synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that most existing methods, including those incorporating various regularization techniques and data-driven priors, struggle to generalize effectively to OOD views. To address this limitation, we introduce SplatFormer, the first point transformer model specifically designed to operate on Gaussian splats. SplatFormer takes as input an initial 3DGS set optimized under limited training views and refines it in a single forward pass, effectively removing potential artifacts in OOD test views. To our knowledge, this is the first successful application of point transformers directly on 3DGS sets, surpassing the limitations of previous multi-scene training methods, which could handle only a restricted number of input views during inference. Our model significantly improves rendering quality under extreme novel views, achieving state-of-the-art performance in these challenging scenarios and outperforming various 3DGS regularization techniques, multi-scene models tailored for sparse view synthesis, and diffusion-based frameworks.",

Experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes demonstrate our method's ability to accurately model scenes viewed through protective covers, achieving a significant improvement in rendering quality compared to prior methods. We also show that the model can adjust well to various cover geometries with synthetic sequences captured with covers of different surface curvatures.

However, it faces several challenges, including Gaussian redundancy, limited ability to capture view-dependent effects, and difficulties in handling complex lighting and specular reflections. Additionally, methods that use spherical harmonics for color representation often struggle to effectively capture specular highlights and anisotropic components, especially when modeling view-dependent colors under complex lighting conditions, leading to insufficient contrast and unnatural color saturation. To address these limitations, we introduce PEP-GS, a perceptually-enhanced framework that dynamically predicts Gaussian attributes, including opacity, color, and covariance. We replace traditional spherical harmonics with a Hierarchical Granular-Structural Attention mechanism, which enables more accurate modeling of complex view-dependent color effects and specular highlights. By employing a stable and interpretable framework for opacity and covariance estimation, PEP-GS avoids the removal of essential Gaussians prematurely, ensuring a more accurate scene representation. Furthermore, perceptual optimization is applied to the final rendered images, enhancing perceptual consistency across different views and ensuring high-quality renderings with improved texture fidelity and fine-scale detail preservation. Experimental results demonstrate that PEP-GS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving view-dependent effects, specular reflections, and fine-scale details.",

Our MVSplat360 addresses this by effectively combining geometry-aware 3D reconstruction with temporally consistent video generation. Specifically, it refactors a feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model to render features directly into the latent space of a pre-trained Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) model, where these features then act as pose and visual cues to guide the denoising process and produce photorealistic 3D-consistent views.

By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can generate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose formulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or Bundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to extend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that refines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images. GS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve environmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and flexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging disruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the LineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly competitive results. The code for GS2Pose will soon be released on GitHub.",

    "abstract": "We present 3DGS-CD, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based method for detecting physical object rearrangements in 3D scenes. Our approach estimates 3D object-level changes by comparing two sets of unaligned images taken at different times. Leveraging 3DGS's novel view rendering and EfficientSAM's zero-shot segmentation capabilities, we detect 2D object-level changes, which are then associated and fused across views to estimate 3D change masks and object transformations. Our method can accurately identify changes in cluttered environments using sparse (as few as one) post-change images within as little as 18s. It does not rely on depth input, user instructions, pre-defined object classes, or object models -- An object is recognized simply if it has been re-arranged. Our approach is evaluated on both public and self-collected real-world datasets, achieving up to 14% higher accuracy and three orders of magnitude faster performance compared to the state-of-the-art radiance-field-based change detection method. This significant performance boost enables a broad range of downstream applications, where we highlight three key use cases: object reconstruction, robot workspace reset, and 3DGS model update.

    "abstract": "Despite the substantial progress of novel view synthesis, existing methods, either based on the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or more recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), suffer significant degradation when the input becomes sparse. Numerous efforts have been introduced to alleviate this problem, but they still struggle to synthesize satisfactory results efficiently, especially in the large scene. In this paper, we propose SCGaussian, a Structure Consistent Gaussian Splatting method using matching priors to learn 3D consistent scene structure. Considering the high interdependence of Gaussian attributes, we optimize the scene structure in two folds: rendering geometry and, more importantly, the position of Gaussian primitives, which is hard to be directly constrained in the vanilla 3DGS due to the non-structure property. To achieve this, we present a hybrid Gaussian representation. Besides the ordinary non-structure Gaussian primitives, our model also consists of ray-based Gaussian primitives that are bound to matching rays and whose optimization of their positions is restricted along the ray. Thus, we can utilize the matching correspondence to directly enforce the position of these Gaussian primitives to converge to the surface points where rays intersect. Extensive experiments on forward-facing, surrounding, and complex large scenes show the effectiveness of our approach with state-of-the-art performance and high efficiency.

To address this gap, we propose a method which advances the literature of continuous semantic mapping from voxels to ellipsoids, combining the precise structure of 3D-GS with the ability to quantify uncertainty of probabilistic robotic maps. Given a set of images, our algorithm performs a probabilistic semantic update directly on the 3D ellipsoids to obtain an expectation and variance through the use of conjugate priors. We also propose a probabilistic rasterization which returns per-pixel segmentation predictions with quantifiable uncertainty.

However, there aren't established tools to support end-user hardware troubleshooting or routine maintenance. As a result, technical support for hardware remains ad-hoc and challenging to scale. Inspired by software troubleshooting workflows like StackOverflow, we propose a workflow for asynchronous hardware troubleshooting: SplatOverflow. SplatOverflow creates a novel boundary object, the SplatOverflow scene, that users reference to communicate about hardware. The scene comprises a 3D Gaussian Splat of the user's hardware registered onto the hardware's CAD model. The splat captures the current state of the hardware, and the registered CAD model acts as a referential anchor for troubleshooting instructions. With SplatOverflow, maintainers can directly address issues and author instructions in the user's workspace. The instructions define workflows that can easily be shared between users and recontextualized in new environments. In this paper, we describe the design of SplatOverflow, detail the workflows it enables, and illustrate its utility to different kinds of users. We also validate that non-experts can use SplatOverflow to troubleshoot common problems with a 3D printer in a user study.",

Gaussian Splatting became widely adopted due to its efficiency and ability to render novel views accurately. While Gaussian Splatting performs well when a sufficient amount of training images are available, its unstructured explicit representation tends to overfit in scenarios with sparse input images, resulting in poor rendering performance. To address this, we present a 3D Gaussian-based novel view synthesis method using sparse input images that can accurately render the scene from the viewpoints not covered by the training images. We propose a multi-stage training scheme with matching-based consistency constraints imposed on the novel views without relying on pre-trained depth estimation or diffusion models. This is achieved by using the matches of the available training images to supervise the generation of the novel views sampled between the training frames with color, geometry, and semantic losses. In addition, we introduce a locality preserving regularization for 3D Gaussians which removes rendering artifacts by preserving the local color structure of the scene.

Our PCoTTA involves three key components: automatic prototype mixture (APM), Gaussian Splatted feature shifting (GSFS), and contrastive prototype repulsion (CPR). Firstly, APM is designed to automatically mix the source prototypes with the learnable prototypes with a similarity balancing factor, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Then, GSFS dynamically shifts the testing sample toward the source domain, mitigating error accumulation in an online manner. In addition, CPR is proposed to pull the nearest learnable prototype close to the testing feature and push it away from other prototypes, making each prototype distinguishable during the adaptation. Experimental comparisons lead to a new benchmark, demonstrating PCoTTA's superiority in boosting the model's transferability towards the continually changing target domain.",

    "abstract": "Representing underwater 3D scenes is a valuable yet complex task, as attenuation and scattering effects during underwater imaging significantly couple the information of the objects and the water. This coupling presents a significant challenge for existing methods in effectively representing both the objects and the water medium simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose Aquatic-GS, a hybrid 3D representation approach for underwater scenes that effectively represents both the objects and the water medium. Specifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the water parameters, while extending the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to model the objects explicitly. Both components are integrated through a physics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater scenes. Moreover, to construct more precise scene geometry and details, we design a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map as auxiliary guidance. After optimization, Aquatic-GS enables the rendering of novel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of underwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that Aquatic-GS surpasses state-of-the-art underwater 3D representation methods, achieving better rendering quality and real-time rendering performance with a 410x increase in speed.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, the 3DGS model tends to overfit when trained with sparse posed views, limiting its generalization ability to novel views. In this paper, we alleviate the overfitting problem, presenting a Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting (SE-GS) approach. Our method encompasses a $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model and a $\\mathbf{\\Delta}$-model. The $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model serves as an ensemble of 3DGS models that generates novel-view images during inference. We achieve the self-ensembling by introducing an uncertainty-aware perturbation strategy at the training state. We complement the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model with the $\\mathbf{\\Delta}$-model, which is dynamically perturbed based on the uncertainties of novel-view renderings across different training steps. The perturbation yields diverse temporal samples in the Gaussian parameter space without additional training costs. The geometry of the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model is regularized by penalizing discrepancies between the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model and these temporal samples. Therefore, our SE-GS conducts an effective and efficient regularization across a large number of 3DGS models, resulting in a robust ensemble, the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model. Our experimental results on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and MVImgNet datasets show that our approach improves NVS quality with few-shot training views, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

The reconstructed avatars can be animated and relit in real time with the global illumination of diverse environments. Unlike existing approaches that estimate parametric reflectance parameters via inverse rendering, our approach directly models learnable radiance transfer that incorporates global light transport in an efficient manner for real-time rendering. However, learning such a complex light transport that can generalize across identities is non-trivial. A phone scan in a single environment lacks sufficient information to infer how the head would appear in general environments. To address this, we build a universal relightable avatar model represented by 3D Gaussians. We train on hundreds of high-quality multi-view human scans with controllable point lights. High-resolution geometric guidance further enhances the reconstruction accuracy and generalization. Once trained, we finetune the pretrained model on a phone scan using inverse rendering to obtain a personalized relightable avatar. Our experiments establish the efficacy of our design, outperforming existing approaches while retaining real-time rendering capability.",

    "abstract": "We introduce NoPoSplat, a feed-forward model capable of reconstructing 3D scenes parameterized by 3D Gaussians from \\textit{unposed} sparse multi-view images. Our model, trained exclusively with photometric loss, achieves real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction during inference. To eliminate the need for accurate pose input during reconstruction, we anchor one input view's local camera coordinates as the canonical space and train the network to predict Gaussian primitives for all views within this space. This approach obviates the need to transform Gaussian primitives from local coordinates into a global coordinate system, thus avoiding errors associated with per-frame Gaussians and pose estimation. To resolve scale ambiguity, we design and compare various intrinsic embedding methods, ultimately opting to convert camera intrinsics into a token embedding and concatenate it with image tokens as input to the model, enabling accurate scene scale prediction. We utilize the reconstructed 3D Gaussians for novel view synthesis and pose estimation tasks and propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine pipeline for accurate pose estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our pose-free approach can achieve superior novel view synthesis quality compared to pose-required methods, particularly in scenarios with limited input image overlap. For pose estimation, our method, trained without ground truth depth or explicit matching loss, significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with substantial improvements.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of physically-based inverse rendering using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations. While recent 3DGS methods have achieved remarkable results in novel view synthesis (NVS), accurately capturing high-fidelity geometry, physically interpretable materials and lighting remains challenging, as it requires precise geometry modeling to provide accurate surface normals, along with physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to ensure correct material and lighting disentanglement. Previous 3DGS methods resort to approximating surface normals, but often struggle with noisy local geometry, leading to inaccurate normal estimation and suboptimal material-lighting decomposition. In this paper, we introduce GeoSplatting, a novel hybrid representation that augments 3DGS with explicit geometric guidance and differentiable PBR equations. Specifically, we bridge isosurface and 3DGS together, where we first extract isosurface mesh from a scalar field, then convert it into 3DGS points and formulate PBR equations for them in a fully differentiable manner. In GeoSplatting, 3DGS is grounded on the mesh geometry, enabling precise surface normal modeling, which facilitates the use of PBR frameworks for material decomposition. This approach further maintains the efficiency and quality of NVS from 3DGS while ensuring accurate geometry from the isosurface. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the superiority of GeoSplatting, consistently outperforming existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

To protect the copyright of these assets, digital watermarking techniques can be applied to embed ownership information discreetly within 3DGS models.

Naively embedding the watermark on a pre-trained 3DGS can cause obvious distortion in rendered images. In our work, we propose an uncertainty-based method that constrains the perturbation of model parameters to achieve invisible watermarking for 3DGS.

To address this, we propose GS-Blur, a dataset of synthesized realistic blurry images created using a novel approach. To this end, we first reconstruct 3D scenes from multi-view images using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), then render blurry images by moving the camera view along the randomly generated motion trajectories. By adopting various camera trajectories in reconstructing our GS-Blur, our dataset contains realistic and diverse types of blur, offering a large-scale dataset that generalizes well to real-world blur. Using GS-Blur with various deblurring methods, we demonstrate its ability to generalize effectively compared to previous synthetic or real blur datasets, showing significant improvements in deblurring performance.",

    "abstract": "Generalizable 3D Gaussian splitting (3DGS) can reconstruct new scenes from sparse-view observations in a feed-forward inference manner, eliminating the need for scene-specific retraining required in conventional 3DGS. However, existing methods rely heavily on epipolar priors, which can be unreliable in complex realworld scenes, particularly in non-overlapping and occluded regions. In this paper, we propose eFreeSplat, an efficient feed-forward 3DGS-based model for generalizable novel view synthesis that operates independently of epipolar line constraints. To enhance multiview feature extraction with 3D perception, we employ a selfsupervised Vision Transformer (ViT) with cross-view completion pre-training on large-scale datasets. Additionally, we introduce an Iterative Cross-view Gaussians Alignment method to ensure consistent depth scales across different views. Our eFreeSplat represents an innovative approach for generalizable novel view synthesis. Different from the existing pure geometry-free methods, eFreeSplat focuses more on achieving epipolar-free feature matching and encoding by providing 3D priors through cross-view pretraining. We evaluate eFreeSplat on wide-baseline novel view synthesis tasks using the RealEstate10K and ACID datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that eFreeSplat surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that rely on epipolar priors, achieving superior geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis quality.

To prevent such infringement, we propose a novel image protection approach that embeds invisible geometry perturbations, termed \"geometry cloaks\", into images before supplying them to TGS. These carefully crafted perturbations encode a customized message that is revealed when TGS attempts 3D reconstructions of the cloaked image. Unlike conventional adversarial attacks that simply degrade output quality, our method forces TGS to fail the 3D reconstruction in a specific way - by generating an identifiable customized pattern that acts as a watermark.

We achieve this through identifying and addressing unique challenges arising from the use of pixel-aligned 3DGS: misaligned 3D Gaussians across different views induce noisy or sparse gradients that destabilize training and hinder convergence, especially when above assumptions are not met. To mitigate this, we employ pre-trained monocular depth estimation and visual correspondence models to achieve coarse alignments of 3D Gaussians. We then introduce lightweight, learnable modules to refine depth and pose estimates from the coarse alignments, improving the quality of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Furthermore, the refined estimates are leveraged to estimate geometry confidence scores, which assess the reliability of 3D Gaussian centers and condition the prediction of Gaussian parameters accordingly.

    "abstract": "The key challenge of multi-view indoor 3D object detection is to infer accurate geometry information from images for precise 3D detection. Previous method relies on NeRF for geometry reasoning. However, the geometry extracted from NeRF is generally inaccurate, which leads to sub-optimal detection performance. In this paper, we propose MVSDet which utilizes plane sweep for geometry-aware 3D object detection. To circumvent the requirement for a large number of depth planes for accurate depth prediction, we design a probabilistic sampling and soft weighting mechanism to decide the placement of pixel features on the 3D volume. We select multiple locations that score top in the probability volume for each pixel and use their probability score to indicate the confidence. We further apply recent pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting to regularize depth prediction and improve detection performance with little computation overhead. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and ARKitScenes datasets are conducted to show the superiority of our model. Our code is available at https://github.com/Pixie8888/MVSDet.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Gaussian splatting has received more and more attention in the field of static scene rendering. Due to the low computational overhead and inherent flexibility of explicit representations, plane-based explicit methods are popular ways to predict deformations for Gaussian-based dynamic scene rendering models. However, plane-based methods rely on the inappropriate low-rank assumption and excessively decompose the space-time 4D encoding, resulting in overmuch feature overlap and unsatisfactory rendering quality. To tackle these problems, we propose Grid4D, a dynamic scene rendering model based on Gaussian splatting and employing a novel explicit encoding method for the 4D input through the hash encoding. Different from plane-based explicit representations, we decompose the 4D encoding into one spatial and three temporal 3D hash encodings without the low-rank assumption. Additionally, we design a novel attention module that generates the attention scores in a directional range to aggregate the spatial and temporal features. The directional attention enables Grid4D to more accurately fit the diverse deformations across distinct scene components based on the spatial encoded features. Moreover, to mitigate the inherent lack of smoothness in explicit representation methods, we introduce a smooth regularization term that keeps our model from the chaos of deformation prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that Grid4D significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in visual quality and rendering speed.",

The emergence of Gaussian Splatting technology has enabled the rendering of Gaussian avatars with superior visual quality and reduced computational costs.

In this paper, we introduce LoDAvatar, a method that introduces levels of detail into Gaussian avatars through hierarchical embedding and selective detail enhancement methods. The key steps of LoDAvatar encompass data preparation, Gaussian embedding, Gaussian optimization, and selective detail enhancement. We conducted experiments involving Gaussian avatars at various levels of detail, employing both objective assessments and subjective evaluations. The outcomes indicate that incorporating levels of detail into Gaussian avatars can decrease computational costs during rendering while upholding commendable visual quality, thereby enhancing runtime frame rates.

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in text-guided image generation have significantly advanced the field of 3D generation. While generating a single high-quality 3D object is now feasible, generating multiple objects with reasonable interactions within a 3D space, a.k.a. compositional 3D generation, presents substantial challenges. This paper introduces CompGS, a novel generative framework that employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) for efficient, compositional text-to-3D content generation. To achieve this goal, two core designs are proposed: (1) 3D Gaussians Initialization with 2D compositionality: We transfer the well-established 2D compositionality to initialize the Gaussian parameters on an entity-by-entity basis, ensuring both consistent 3D priors for each entity and reasonable interactions among multiple entities; (2) Dynamic Optimization: We propose a dynamic strategy to optimize 3D Gaussians using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. CompGS first automatically decomposes 3D Gaussians into distinct entity parts, enabling optimization at both the entity and composition levels. Additionally, CompGS optimizes across objects of varying scales by dynamically adjusting the spatial parameters of each entity, enhancing the generation of fine-grained details, particularly in smaller entities. Qualitative comparisons and quantitative evaluations on T3Bench demonstrate the effectiveness of CompGS in generating compositional 3D objects with superior image quality and semantic alignment over existing methods. CompGS can also be easily extended to controllable 3D editing, facilitating scene generation. We hope CompGS will provide new insights to the compositional 3D generation.

    "abstract": "Omnidirectional (or 360-degree) images are increasingly being used for 3D applications since they allow the rendering of an entire scene with a single image. Existing works based on neural radiance fields demonstrate successful 3D reconstruction quality on egocentric videos, yet they suffer from long training and rendering times. Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has gained attention for its fast optimization and real-time rendering. However, directly using a perspective rasterizer to omnidirectional images results in severe distortion due to the different optical properties between two image domains. In this work, we present ODGS, a novel rasterization pipeline for omnidirectional images, with geometric interpretation. For each Gaussian, we define a tangent plane that touches the unit sphere and is perpendicular to the ray headed toward the Gaussian center. We then leverage a perspective camera rasterizer to project the Gaussian onto the corresponding tangent plane. The projected Gaussians are transformed and combined into the omnidirectional image, finalizing the omnidirectional rasterization process. This interpretation reveals the implicit assumptions within the proposed pipeline, which we verify through mathematical proofs. The entire rasterization process is parallelized using CUDA, achieving optimization and rendering speeds 100 times faster than NeRF-based methods. Our comprehensive experiments highlight the superiority of ODGS by delivering the best reconstruction and perceptual quality across various datasets. Additionally, results on roaming datasets demonstrate that ODGS restores fine details effectively, even when reconstructing large 3D scenes.

Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-fidelity novel view synthesis at real-time speeds. However, the noisy and discrete nature of 3D Gaussian primitives hinders accurate surface estimation. Previous attempts to regularize 3D Gaussian normals often degrade rendering quality due to the fundamental disconnect between normal vectors and the rendering pipeline in 3DGS-based methods. Therefore, we introduce Normal-GS, a novel approach that integrates normal vectors into the 3DGS rendering pipeline. The core idea is to model the interaction between normals and incident lighting using the physically-based rendering equation. Our approach re-parameterizes surface colors as the product of normals and a designed Integrated Directional Illumination Vector (IDIV). To optimize memory usage and simplify optimization, we employ an anchor-based 3DGS to implicitly encode locally-shared IDIVs. Additionally, Normal-GS leverages optimized normals and Integrated Directional Encoding (IDE) to accurately model specular effects, enhancing both rendering quality and surface normal precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Normal-GS achieves near state-of-the-art visual quality while obtaining accurate surface normals and preserving real-time rendering performance.",

Our method encodes reconstructed scenes using a novel representation VoxSplat, which is a set of 3D Gaussians supported on a high-resolution sparse-voxel scaffold. To reconstruct a VoxSplat from images, we employ a hierarchical voxel latent diffusion model conditioned on the input images followed by a feedforward appearance prediction model. The diffusion model generates high-resolution grids progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner, and the appearance network predicts a set of Gaussians within each voxel. From as few as 3 non-overlapping input images, SCube can generate millions of Gaussians with a 1024^3 voxel grid spanning hundreds of meters in 20 seconds. Past works tackling scene reconstruction from images either rely on per-scene optimization and fail to reconstruct the scene away from input views (thus requiring dense view coverage as input) or leverage geometric priors based on low-resolution models, which produce blurry results. In contrast, SCube leverages high-resolution sparse networks and produces sharp outputs from few views. We show the superiority of SCube compared to prior art using the Waymo self-driving dataset on 3D reconstruction and demonstrate its applications, such as LiDAR simulation and text-to-scene generation.",

DiffGS is a powerful and efficient 3D generative model which is capable of generating Gaussian primitives at arbitrary numbers for high-fidelity rendering with rasterization. The key insight is to represent Gaussian Splatting in a disentangled manner via three novel functions to model Gaussian probabilities, colors and transforms. Through the novel disentanglement of 3DGS, we represent the discrete and unstructured 3DGS with continuous Gaussian Splatting functions, where we then train a latent diffusion model with the target of generating these Gaussian Splatting functions both unconditionally and conditionally. Meanwhile, we introduce a discretization algorithm to extract Gaussians at arbitrary numbers from the generated functions via octree-guided sampling and optimization. We explore DiffGS for various tasks, including unconditional generation, conditional generation from text, image, and partial 3DGS, as well as Point-to-Gaussian generation.

To create more expressive and realistic illustrations, these images are typically manually colorized by an artist with the support of image editing software. This task becomes highly laborious when multiple images of a scanned object require colorization. We propose facilitating this process by using the underlying 3D structure of the microscopic scene to propagate the color information to all the captured images, from as little as one colorized view. We explore several scene representation techniques and achieve high-quality colorized novel view synthesis of a SEM scene. In contrast to prior work, there is no manual intervention or labelling involved in obtaining the 3D representation. This enables an artist to color a single or few views of a sequence and automatically retrieve a fully colored scene or video. Project page: https://ronly2460.github.io/ArCSEM",

Specifically, we introduce a Cascade Gaussian Adapter to adjust Gaussian distribution according to local geometry complexity identified by a keypoint scorer. CGA leverages deformable attention in context-aware hypernetworks to guide Gaussian pruning and splitting, ensuring accurate representation in complex regions while reducing redundancy. Furthermore, we design a transformer-based Iterative Gaussian Refiner module that refines Gaussian representations through direct image-Gaussian interactions. Our PixelGaussian can effectively reduce Gaussian redundancy as input views increase.

    "abstract": "Multi-view image diffusion models have significantly advanced open-domain 3D object generation. However, most existing models rely on 2D network architectures that lack inherent 3D biases, resulting in compromised geometric consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-in module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusion models. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: for each denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediate multi-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes the rendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through feature addition. We study two variants of 3D-Adapter: a fast feed-forward version based on Gaussian splatting and a versatile training-free version utilizing neural fields and meshes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-Adapter not only greatly enhances the geometry quality of text-to-multi-view models such as Instant3D and Zero123++, but also enables high-quality 3D generation using the plain text-to-image Stable Diffusion. Furthermore, we showcase the broad application potential of 3D-Adapter by presenting high quality results in text-to-3D, image-to-3D, text-to-texture, and text-to-avatar tasks.",

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a significant advancement in 3D scene reconstruction, attracting considerable attention due to its ability to recover high-fidelity details while maintaining low complexity. Despite the promising results achieved by 3DGS, its rendering performance is constrained by its dependence on costly non-commutative alpha-blending operations. These operations mandate complex view dependent sorting operations that introduce computational overhead, especially on the resource-constrained platforms such as mobile phones. In this paper, we propose Weighted Sum Rendering, which approximates alpha blending with weighted sums, thereby removing the need for sorting. This simplifies implementation, delivers superior performance, and eliminates the \"popping\" artifacts caused by sorting. Experimental results show that optimizing a generalized Gaussian splatting formulation to the new differentiable rendering yields competitive image quality. The method was implemented and tested in a mobile device GPU, achieving on average $1.23\\times$ faster rendering.",

However, existing video prediction approaches typically do not explicitly account for the 3D information from videos, such as robot actions and objects' 3D states, limiting their use in real-world robotic applications. In this work, we introduce a framework to learn object dynamics directly from multi-view RGB videos by explicitly considering the robot's action trajectories and their effects on scene dynamics. We utilize the 3D Gaussian representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to train a particle-based dynamics model using Graph Neural Networks. This model operates on sparse control particles downsampled from the densely tracked 3D Gaussian reconstructions. By learning the neural dynamics model on offline robot interaction data, our method can predict object motions under varying initial configurations and unseen robot actions. The 3D transformations of Gaussians can be interpolated from the motions of control particles, enabling the rendering of predicted future object states and achieving action-conditioned video prediction. The dynamics model can also be applied to model-based planning frameworks for object manipulation tasks. We conduct experiments on various kinds of deformable materials, including ropes, clothes, and stuffed animals, demonstrating our framework's ability to model complex shapes and dynamics.

Previous methods explore 3D Gaussian Splatting with neural priors (e.g. depth priors) as an additional supervision, demonstrating promising quality and efficiency compared to the NeRF based methods. However, the neural priors from 2D pretrained models are often noisy and blurry, which struggle to precisely guide the learning of radiance fields. In this paper, We propose a novel method for synthesizing novel views from sparse views with Gaussian Splatting that does not require external prior as supervision. Our key idea lies in exploring the self-supervisions inherent in the binocular stereo consistency between each pair of binocular images constructed with disparity-guided image warping. To this end, we additionally introduce a Gaussian opacity constraint which regularizes the Gaussian locations and avoids Gaussian redundancy for improving the robustness and efficiency of inferring 3D Gaussians from sparse views.

In this paper, we propose foveated rendering as a promising solution to these obstacles. We analyze state-of-the-art NVS methods with respect to their rendering performance and compatibility with the human visual system. Our approach introduces a novel foveated rendering approach for Virtual Reality, that leverages the sharp, detailed output of neural point rendering for the foveal region, fused with a smooth rendering of 3DGS for the peripheral vision.   Our evaluation confirms that perceived sharpness and detail-richness are increased by our approach compared to a standard VR-ready 3DGS configuration.

    "abstract": "Previous methods utilize the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for panoptic lifting, while their training and rendering speed are unsatisfactory. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent technique due to its rapid training and rendering speed. However, unlike NeRF, the conventional 3DGS may not satisfy the basic smoothness assumption as it does not rely on any parameterized structures to render (e.g., MLPs). Consequently, the conventional 3DGS is, in nature, more susceptible to noisy 2D mask supervision. In this paper, we propose a new method called PLGS that enables 3DGS to generate consistent panoptic segmentation masks from noisy 2D segmentation masks while maintaining superior efficiency compared to NeRF-based methods. Specifically, we build a panoptic-aware structured 3D Gaussian model to introduce smoothness and design effective noise reduction strategies. For the semantic field, instead of initialization with structure from motion, we construct reliable semantic anchor points to initialize the 3D Gaussians. We then use these anchor points as smooth regularization during training. Additionally, we present a self-training approach using pseudo labels generated by merging the rendered masks with the noisy masks to enhance the robustness of PLGS. For the instance field, we project the 2D instance masks into 3D space and match them with oriented bounding boxes to generate cross-view consistent instance masks for supervision. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of both segmentation quality and speed.",

Both models bypass the 3D inductive biases used in previous methods -- from 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3DGS) to network designs (e.g., epipolar projections, plane sweeps) -- addressing novel view synthesis with a fully data-driven approach. While the encoder-decoder model offers faster inference due to its independent latent representation, the decoder-only LVSM achieves superior quality, scalability, and zero-shot generalization, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by 1.5 to 3.5 dB PSNR. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that both LVSM variants achieve state-of-the-art novel view synthesis quality.

However, robotic applications often face challenges such as motion blur, insufficient illumination, and high computational overhead, which adversely affect downstream tasks like navigation, inspection, and scene visualization. To address these challenges, we propose E-3DGS, a novel event-based approach that partitions events into motion (from camera or object movement) and exposure (from camera exposure), using the former to handle fast-motion scenes and using the latter to reconstruct grayscale images for high-quality training and optimization of event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We introduce a novel integration of 3DGS with exposure events for high-quality reconstruction of explicit scene representations. Our versatile framework can operate on motion events alone for 3D reconstruction, enhance quality using exposure events, or adopt a hybrid mode that balances quality and effectiveness by optimizing with initial exposure events followed by high-speed motion events. We also introduce EME-3D, a real-world 3D dataset with exposure events, motion events, camera calibration parameters, and sparse point clouds. Our method is faster and delivers better reconstruction quality than event-based NeRF while being more cost-effective than NeRF methods that combine event and RGB data by using a single event sensor. By combining motion and exposure events, E-3DGS sets a new benchmark for event-based 3D reconstruction with robust performance in challenging conditions and lower hardware demands.

Rendering high-quality visualizations in real-time, however, is computationally intensive and impractical for compute-constrained devices like mobile headsets.   We propose a novel approach utilizing GS to create an efficient but static intermediate representation of CT scans. We introduce a layered GS representation, incrementally including different anatomical structures while minimizing overlap and extending the GS training to remove inactive Gaussians. We further compress the created model with clustering across layers.   Our approach achieves interactive frame rates while preserving anatomical structures, with quality adjustable to the target hardware. Compared to standard GS, our representation retains some of the explorative qualities initially enabled by immersive path tracing. Selective activation and clipping of layers are possible at rendering time, adding a degree of interactivity to otherwise static GS models. This could enable scenarios where high computational demands would otherwise prohibit using path-traced medical volumes.",

Existing 3D drag-based editing methods, whether employing explicit spatial transformations or relying on implicit latent optimization within limited-capacity 3D generative models, fall short in handling significant topology changes or generating new textures across diverse object categories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MVDrag3D, a novel framework for more flexible and creative drag-based 3D editing that leverages multi-view generation and reconstruction priors. At the core of our approach is the usage of a multi-view diffusion model as a strong generative prior to perform consistent drag editing over multiple rendered views, which is followed by a reconstruction model that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of the edited object. While the initial 3D Gaussians may suffer from misalignment between different views, we address this via view-specific deformation networks that adjust the position of Gaussians to be well aligned. In addition, we propose a multi-view score function that distills generative priors from multiple views to further enhance the view consistency and visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVDrag3D provides a precise, generative, and flexible solution for 3D drag-based editing, supporting more versatile editing effects across various object categories and 3D representations.",

    "abstract": "Novel-view synthesis aims to generate novel views of a scene from multiple input images or videos, and recent advancements like 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) have achieved notable success in producing photorealistic renderings with efficient pipelines. However, generating high-quality novel views under challenging settings, such as sparse input views, remains difficult due to insufficient information in under-sampled areas, often resulting in noticeable artifacts. This paper presents 3DGS-Enhancer, a novel pipeline for enhancing the representation quality of 3DGS representations. We leverage 2D video diffusion priors to address the challenging 3D view consistency problem, reformulating it as achieving temporal consistency within a video generation process. 3DGS-Enhancer restores view-consistent latent features of rendered novel views and integrates them with the input views through a spatial-temporal decoder.

    "abstract": "Combining accurate geometry with rich semantics has been proven to be highly effective for language-guided robotic manipulation. Existing methods for dynamic scenes either fail to update in real-time or rely on additional depth sensors for simple scene editing, limiting their applicability in real-world. In this paper, we introduce MSGField, a representation that uses a collection of 2D Gaussians for high-quality reconstruction, further enhanced with attributes to encode semantic and motion information. Specially, we represent the motion field compactly by decomposing each primitive's motion into a combination of a limited set of motion bases. Leveraging the differentiable real-time rendering of Gaussian splatting, we can quickly optimize object motion, even for complex non-rigid motions, with image supervision from only two camera views. Additionally, we designed a pipeline that utilizes object priors to efficiently obtain well-defined semantics. In our challenging dataset, which includes flexible and extremely small objects, our method achieve a success rate of 79.2% in static and 63.3% in dynamic environments for language-guided manipulation. For specified object grasping, we achieve a success rate of 90%, on par with point cloud-based methods. Code and dataset will be released at:https://shengyu724.github.io/MSGField.github.io.",

However, these methods often struggle with controllability, as they lack information from multiple views, leading to incomplete or inconsistent 3D reconstructions. To address this limitation, we introduce LucidFusion, a flexible end-to-end feed-forward framework that leverages the Relative Coordinate Map (RCM). Unlike traditional methods linking images to 3D world thorough pose, LucidFusion utilizes RCM to align geometric features coherently across different views, making it highly adaptable for 3D generation from arbitrary, unposed images. Furthermore, LucidFusion seamlessly integrates with the original single-image-to-3D pipeline, producing detailed 3D Gaussians at a resolution of $512 \\times 512$, making it well-suited for a wide range of applications.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting has shown fast and high-quality rendering results in static scenes by leveraging dense 3D prior and explicit representations. Unfortunately, the benefits of the prior and representation do not involve novel view synthesis for dynamic motions. Ironically, this is because the main barrier is the reliance on them, which requires increasing training and rendering times to account for dynamic motions. In this paper, we design a Explicit 4D Gaussian Splatting(Ex4DGS). Our key idea is to firstly separate static and dynamic Gaussians during training, and to explicitly sample positions and rotations of the dynamic Gaussians at sparse timestamps. The sampled positions and rotations are then interpolated to represent both spatially and temporally continuous motions of objects in dynamic scenes as well as reducing computational cost. Additionally, we introduce a progressive training scheme and a point-backtracking technique that improves Ex4DGS's convergence. We initially train Ex4DGS using short timestamps and progressively extend timestamps, which makes it work well with a few point clouds. The point-backtracking is used to quantify the cumulative error of each Gaussian over time, enabling the detection and removal of erroneous Gaussians in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments on various scenes demonstrate the state-of-the-art rendering quality from our method, achieving fast rendering of 62 fps on a single 2080Ti GPU.",

    "abstract": "Scene reconstruction from casually captured videos has wide applications in real-world scenarios. With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS. Our project page is https://lbh666.github.io/ef-3dgs/.",

Graph diffusion refines 3D features, such as coarse segmentation masks, by leveraging 3D geometry and pairwise similarities induced by DINOv2. Our approach achieves performance comparable to the state of the art on multiple downstream tasks while delivering significant speed-ups.

    "abstract": "It is vital to infer a signed distance function (SDF) in multi-view based surface reconstruction. 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) provides a novel perspective for volume rendering, and shows advantages in rendering efficiency and quality. Although 3DGS provides a promising neural rendering option, it is still hard to infer SDFs for surface reconstruction with 3DGS due to the discreteness, the sparseness, and the off-surface drift of 3D Gaussians. To resolve these issues, we propose a method that seamlessly merge 3DGS with the learning of neural SDFs. Our key idea is to more effectively constrain the SDF inference with the multi-view consistency. To this end, we dynamically align 3D Gaussians on the zero-level set of the neural SDF using neural pulling, and then render the aligned 3D Gaussians through the differentiable rasterization. Meanwhile, we update the neural SDF by pulling neighboring space to the pulled 3D Gaussians, which progressively refine the signed distance field near the surface. With both differentiable pulling and splatting, we jointly optimize 3D Gaussians and the neural SDF with both RGB and geometry constraints, which recovers more accurate, smooth, and complete surfaces with more geometry details. Our numerical and visual comparisons show our superiority over the state-of-the-art results on the widely used benchmarks.",

However, merely decomposing 4D dynamic scenes into multiple 2D plane-based representations is insufficient for high-fidelity re-rendering of scenes with complex motions. In response, we present DaRePlane, a novel direction-aware representation approach that captures scene dynamics from six different directions. This learned representation undergoes an inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) to recover plane-based information. Within NeRF pipelines, DaRePlane computes features for each space-time point by fusing vectors from these recovered planes, then passed to a tiny MLP for color regression. When applied to Gaussian splatting, DaRePlane computes the features of Gaussian points, followed by a tiny multi-head MLP for spatial-time deformation prediction. Notably, to address redundancy introduced by the six real and six imaginary direction-aware wavelet coefficients, we introduce a trainable masking approach, mitigating storage issues without significant performance decline. To demonstrate the generality and efficiency of DaRePlane, we test it on both regular and surgical dynamic scenes, for both NeRF and GS systems. Extensive experiments show that DaRePlane yields state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for various complex dynamic scenes.",

    "abstract": "4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has recently emerged as a promising technique for capturing complex dynamic 3D scenes with high fidelity. It utilizes a 4D Gaussian representation and a GPU-friendly rasterizer, enabling rapid rendering speeds. Despite its advantages, 4DGS faces significant challenges, notably the requirement of millions of 4D Gaussians, each with extensive associated attributes, leading to substantial memory and storage cost. This paper introduces a memory-efficient framework for 4DGS. We streamline the color attribute by decomposing it into a per-Gaussian direct color component with only 3 parameters and a shared lightweight alternating current color predictor. This approach eliminates the need for spherical harmonics coefficients, which typically involve up to 144 parameters in classic 4DGS, thereby creating a memory-efficient 4D Gaussian representation. Furthermore, we introduce an entropy-constrained Gaussian deformation technique that uses a deformation field to expand the action range of each Gaussian and integrates an opacity-based entropy loss to limit the number of Gaussians, thus forcing our model to use as few Gaussians as possible to fit a dynamic scene well. With simple half-precision storage and zip compression, our framework achieves a storage reduction by approximately 190$\\times$ and 125$\\times$ on the Technicolor and Neural 3D Video datasets, respectively, compared to the original 4DGS. Meanwhile, it maintains comparable rendering speeds and scene representation quality, setting a new standard in the field.",

Although current methods based on NeRF have achieved satisfactory performance, they still can not reach real-time levels. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered researchers attention due to their outstanding rendering quality and real-time speed. Therefore, a new paradigm has been proposed: defining a canonical 3D gaussians and deforming it to individual frames in deformable fields. However, since the coordinates of canonical 3D gaussians are filled with noise, which can transfer noise into the deformable fields, and there is currently no method that adequately considers the aggregation of 4D information. Therefore, we propose Denoised Deformable Network with Temporal-Spatial Aggregation for Dynamic Scene Rendering (DN-4DGS). Specifically, a Noise Suppression Strategy is introduced to change the distribution of the coordinates of the canonical 3D gaussians and suppress noise. Additionally, a Decoupled Temporal-Spatial Aggregation Module is designed to aggregate information from adjacent points and frames. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality under a real-time level.",

Recent advancements in autonomous-driving world models have demonstrated the potential to generate diverse driving videos. However, these approaches remain constrained to 2D video generation, inherently lacking the spatiotemporal coherence required to capture intricacies of dynamic driving environments. In this paper, we introduce DriveDreamer4D, which enhances 4D driving scene representation leveraging world model priors. Specifically, we utilize the world model as a data machine to synthesize novel trajectory videos, where structured conditions are explicitly leveraged to control the spatial-temporal consistency of traffic elements. Besides, the cousin data training strategy is proposed to facilitate merging real and synthetic data for optimizing 4DGS. To our knowledge, DriveDreamer4D is the first to utilize video generation models for improving 4D reconstruction in driving scenarios. Experimental results reveal that DriveDreamer4D significantly enhances generation quality under novel trajectory views, achieving a relative improvement in FID by 32.1%, 46.4%, and 16.3% compared to PVG, S3Gaussian, and Deformable-GS. Moreover, DriveDreamer4D markedly enhances the spatiotemporal coherence of driving agents, which is verified by a comprehensive user study and the relative increases of 22.6%, 43.5%, and 15.6% in the NTA-IoU metric.",

This enables effective generative 3D modeling, scaling to generation of entire room-scale scenes which can be very efficiently rendered. To enable effective synthesis of 3D Gaussians, we propose a latent diffusion formulation, operating in a compressed latent space of 3D Gaussians. This compressed latent space is learned by a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), for which we employ a sparse convolutional architecture to efficiently operate on room-scale scenes. This way, the complexity of the costly generation process via diffusion is substantially reduced, allowing higher detail on object-level generation, as well as scalability to large scenes. By leveraging the 3D Gaussian representation, the generated scenes can be rendered from arbitrary viewpoints in real-time. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves visual quality over prior work on unconditional object-level radiance field synthesis and showcase its applicability to room-scale scene generation.",

While NeRF-based neural reconstruction methods have exhibited impressive reconstruction ability, they tend to be time-comsuming. Recent strategies have adopted 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) for inverse rendering, which have led to quick and effective outcomes. However, these techniques generally have difficulty in producing believable geometries and materials for glossy objects, a challenge that stems from the inherent ambiguities of inverse rendering. To address this, we introduce GlossyGS, an innovative 3D-GS-based inverse rendering framework that aims to precisely reconstruct the geometry and materials of glossy objects by integrating material priors. The key idea is the use of micro-facet geometry segmentation prior, which helps to reduce the intrinsic ambiguities and improve the decomposition of geometries and materials. Additionally, we introduce a normal map prefiltering strategy to more accurately simulate the normal distribution of reflective surfaces. These strategies are integrated into a hybrid geometry and material representation that employs both explicit and implicit methods to depict glossy objects. We demonstrate through quantitative analysis and qualitative visualization that the proposed method is effective to reconstruct high-fidelity geometries and materials of glossy objects, and performs favorably against state-of-the-arts.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present UniG, a view-consistent 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis model that generates a high-fidelity representation of 3D Gaussians from sparse images. Existing 3D Gaussians-based methods usually regress Gaussians per-pixel of each view, create 3D Gaussians per view separately, and merge them through point concatenation. Such a view-independent reconstruction approach often results in a view inconsistency issue, where the predicted positions of the same 3D point from different views may have discrepancies. To address this problem, we develop a DETR (DEtection TRansformer)-like framework, which treats 3D Gaussians as decoder queries and updates their parameters layer by layer by performing multi-view cross-attention (MVDFA) over multiple input images. In this way, multiple views naturally contribute to modeling a unitary representation of 3D Gaussians, thereby making 3D reconstruction more view-consistent. Moreover, as the number of 3D Gaussians used as decoder queries is irrespective of the number of input views, allow an arbitrary number of input images without causing memory explosion. Extensive experiments validate the advantages of our approach, showcasing superior performance over existing methods quantitatively (improving PSNR by 4.2 dB when trained on Objaverse and tested on the GSO benchmark) and qualitatively.

Many approaches rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) technology. However, SDS struggles to accommodate multi-condition inputs, such as text and visual prompts, in customized generation tasks. To explore the core reasons, we decompose SDS into a difference term and a classifier-free guidance term. Our analysis identifies the core issue as arising from the difference term and the random noise addition during the optimization process, both contributing to deviations from the target mode during distillation. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm, Classifier Score Matching (CSM), which removes the difference term in SDS and uses a deterministic noise addition process to reduce noise during optimization, effectively overcoming the low-quality limitations of SDS in our customized generation framework. Based on CSM, we integrate visual prompt information with an attention fusion mechanism and sampling guidance techniques, forming the Visual Prompt CSM (VPCSM) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a Semantic-Geometry Calibration (SGC) module to enhance quality through improved textual information integration. We present our approach as TV-3DG, with extensive experiments demonstrating its capability to achieve stable, high-quality, customized 3D generation.

In the application section, we explore how 3DGS has been utilized in various robotics tasks from scene understanding and interaction perspectives. The advance of 3DGS section focuses on the improvements of 3DGS own properties in its adaptability and efficiency, aiming to enhance its performance in robotics.

This task seeks to find anomalies from query images of a tested object given a set of reference images of an anomaly-free object. The challenge is that the query views (a.k.a poses) are unknown and can be different from the reference views. Currently, new methods such as OmniposeAD and SplatPose have emerged to bridge the gap by synthesizing pseudo reference images at the query views for pixel-to-pixel comparison. However, none of these methods can infer in real-time, which is critical in industrial quality control for massive production. For this reason, we propose SplatPose+, which employs a hybrid representation consisting of a Structure from Motion (SfM) model for localization and a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model for Novel View Synthesis. Although our proposed pipeline requires the computation of an additional SfM model, it offers real-time inference speeds and faster training compared to SplatPose. Quality-wise, we achieved a new SOTA on the Pose-agnostic Anomaly Detection benchmark with the Multi-Pose Anomaly Detection (MAD-SIM) dataset.",

However, with sparse input views, the lack of multi-view consistency constraints results in poorly initialized point clouds and unreliable heuristics for optimization and densification, leading to suboptimal performance. Existing methods often incorporate depth priors from dense estimation networks but overlook the inherent multi-view consistency in input images. Additionally, they rely on multi-view stereo (MVS)-based initialization, which limits the efficiency of scene representation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, named MCGS, enabling photorealistic scene reconstruction from sparse input views. The key innovations of MCGS in enhancing multi-view consistency are as follows: i) We introduce an initialization method by leveraging a sparse matcher combined with a random filling strategy, yielding a compact yet sufficient set of initial points. This approach enhances the initial geometry prior, promoting efficient scene representation. ii) We develop a multi-view consistency-guided progressive pruning strategy to refine the Gaussian field by strengthening consistency and eliminating low-contribution Gaussians. These modular, plug-and-play strategies enhance robustness to sparse input views, accelerate rendering, and reduce memory consumption, making MCGS a practical and efficient framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting.",

Prior methods have utilized drones for data capture and radiance fields for scene reconstruction, both of which present certain challenges. First, in order to capture diverse viewpoints with the drone's front-facing camera, some approaches fly the drone in an unstable zig-zag fashion, which hinders drone-piloting and generates motion blur in the captured data. Secondly, most radiance field methods do not easily scale to arbitrarily large number of images. This paper proposes an efficient and scalable pipeline for indoor novel-view synthesis from drone-captured 360 videos using 3D Gaussian Splatting. 360 cameras capture a wide set of viewpoints, allowing for comprehensive scene capture under a simple straightforward drone trajectory. To scale our method to large scenes, we devise a divide-and-conquer strategy to automatically split the scene into smaller blocks that can be reconstructed individually and in parallel. We also propose a coarse-to-fine alignment strategy to seamlessly match these blocks together to compose the entire scene. Our experiments demonstrate marked improvement in both reconstruction quality, i.e. PSNR and SSIM, and computation time compared to prior approaches.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting has surpassed neural radiance field methods in novel view synthesis by achieving lower computational costs and real-time high-quality rendering. Although it produces a high-quality rendering with a lot of input views, its performance drops significantly when only a few views are available. In this work, we address this by proposing a depth-aware Gaussian splatting method for few-shot novel view synthesis. We use monocular depth prediction as a prior, along with a scale-invariant depth loss, to constrain the 3D shape under just a few input views. We also model color using lower-order spherical harmonics to avoid overfitting. Further, we observe that removing splats with lower opacity periodically, as performed in the original work, leads to a very sparse point cloud and, hence, a lower-quality rendering. To mitigate this, we retain all the splats, leading to a better reconstruction in a few view settings. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the traditional 3D Gaussian splatting methods by achieving improvements of 10.5% in peak signal-to-noise ratio, 6% in structural similarity index, and 14.1% in perceptual similarity, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Human-object interaction (HOI) and human-scene interaction (HSI) are crucial for human-centric scene understanding applications in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI), robotics, and augmented reality (AR). A common limitation faced in these research areas is the data scarcity problem: insufficient labeled human-scene object pairs on the input images, and limited interaction complexity and granularity between them. Recent HOI and HSI methods have addressed this issue by generating dynamic interactions with rigid objects. But more complex dynamic interactions such as a human rider pedaling an articulated bicycle have been unexplored. To address this limitation, and to enable research on complex dynamic human-articulated object interactions, in this paper we propose a method to generate simulated 3D dynamic cyclist assets and interactions. We designed a methodology for creating a new part-based multi-view articulated synthetic 3D bicycle dataset that we call 3DArticBikes that can be used to train NeRF and 3DGS-based 3D reconstruction methods. We then propose a 3DGS-based parametric bicycle composition model to assemble 8-DoF pose-controllable 3D bicycles. Finally, using dynamic information from cyclist videos, we build a complete synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist (rider pedaling a bicycle) by re-posing a selectable synthetic 3D person while automatically placing the rider onto one of our new articulated 3D bicycles using a proposed 3D Keypoint optimization-based Inverse Kinematics pose refinement. We present both, qualitative and quantitative results where we compare our generated cyclists against those from a recent stable diffusion-based method.",

Traditionally, watermarking techniques have been developed primarily for rich information media such as images and audio.

Latent 3D graph diffusion(LDM-3DG) is an ascendant approach in the molecular graph generation field. This model effectively manages the complexities of molecular structures, preserving essential symmetries and topological features. We adapt the Gaussian Shading, a proven performance lossless watermarking technique, to the latent graph diffusion domain to protect this sophisticated new technology. Our adaptation simplifies the watermark diffusion process through duplication and padding, making it adaptable and suitable for various message types. We conduct several experiments using the LDM-3DG model on publicly available datasets QM9 and Drugs, to assess the robustness and effectiveness of our technique. Our results demonstrate that the watermarked molecules maintain statistical parity in 9 out of 10 performance metrics compared to the original. Moreover, they exhibit a 100% detection rate and a 99% extraction rate in a 2D decoded pipeline, while also showing robustness against post-editing attacks.",

In this work, we propose a novel approach that learns a visual dynamics model over Gaussian splatting representations of scenes and leverages this model for manipulating granular media via Model-Predictive Control. Our method enables efficient optimization for complex manipulation tasks on piles of granular media. We evaluate our approach in both simulated and real-world settings, demonstrating its ability to solve unseen planning tasks and generalize to new environments in a zero-shot transfer.

Accurately reconstructing an object's complete 3D structure and texture has numerous applications in real-world scenarios, including robotic manipulation, grasping, 3D scene understanding, and AR/VR. Recent advancements in 3D object generation have introduced techniques that reconstruct an object's 3D shape and texture by optimizing the efficient representation of Gaussian Splatting, guided by pre-trained 2D or 3D diffusion models. However, a notable disparity exists between the training datasets of these models, leading to distinct differences in their outputs. While 2D models generate highly detailed visuals, they lack cross-view consistency in geometry and texture. In contrast, 3D models ensure consistency across different views but often result in overly smooth textures. We propose bridging the gap between 2D and 3D diffusion models to address this limitation by integrating a two-stage frequency-based distillation loss with Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, we leverage geometric priors in the low-frequency spectrum from a 3D diffusion model to maintain consistent geometry and use a 2D diffusion model to refine the fidelity and texture in the high-frequency spectrum of the generated 3D structure, resulting in more detailed and fine-grained outcomes. Our approach enhances geometric consistency and visual quality, outperforming the current SOTA.

To address these challenges, we present SurgicalGS, a dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting framework specifically designed for surgical scene reconstruction with improved geometric accuracy.

We propose a novel approach that integrates mesh representation with 3D Gaussian splats to perform high-quality rendering of reconstructed real-world scenes. In particular, we introduce a distance-based Gaussian splatting technique to align the Gaussian splats with the mesh surface and remove redundant Gaussian splats that do not contribute to the rendering. We consider the distance between each Gaussian splat and the mesh surface to distinguish between tightly-bound and loosely-bound Gaussian splats. The tightly-bound splats are flattened and aligned well with the mesh geometry. The loosely-bound Gaussian splats are used to account for the artifacts in reconstructed 3D meshes in terms of rendering. We present a training strategy of binding Gaussian splats to the mesh geometry, and take into account both types of splats. In this context, we introduce several regularization techniques aimed at precisely aligning tightly-bound Gaussian splats with the mesh surface during the training process. We validate the effectiveness of our method on large and unbounded scene from mip-NeRF 360 and Deep Blending datasets. Our method surpasses recent mesh-based neural rendering techniques by achieving a 2dB higher PSNR, and outperforms mesh-based Gaussian splatting methods by 1.3 dB PSNR, particularly on the outdoor mip-NeRF 360 dataset, demonstrating better rendering quality.

Existing GS-based methods designed for single subjects often yield unsatisfactory results due to limited input views, various hand poses, and occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage interaction-aware GS framework that exploits cross-subject hand priors and refines 3D Gaussians in interacting areas. Particularly, to handle hand variations, we disentangle the 3D presentation of hands into optimization-based identity maps and learning-based latent geometric features and neural texture maps. Learning-based features are captured by trained networks to provide reliable priors for poses, shapes, and textures, while optimization-based identity maps enable efficient one-shot fitting of out-of-distribution hands. Furthermore, we devise an interaction-aware attention module and a self-adaptive Gaussian refinement module. These modules enhance image rendering quality in areas with intra- and inter-hand interactions, overcoming the limitations of existing GS-based methods. Our proposed method is validated via extensive experiments on the large-scale InterHand2.6M dataset, and it significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance in image quality.

However, like most novel-view synthesis approaches, it relies on accurate camera pose information, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios where acquiring accurate camera poses can be challenging or even impossible. We propose an extension to the 3D Gaussian Splatting framework by optimizing the extrinsic camera parameters with respect to photometric residuals. We derive the analytical gradients and integrate their computation with the existing high-performance CUDA implementation. This enables downstream tasks such as 6-DoF camera pose estimation as well as joint reconstruction and camera refinement. In particular, we achieve rapid convergence and high accuracy for pose estimation on real-world scenes. Our method enables fast reconstruction of 3D scenes without requiring accurate pose information by jointly optimizing geometry and camera poses, while achieving state-of-the-art results in novel-view synthesis. Our approach is considerably faster to optimize than most competing methods, and several times faster in rendering. We show results on real-world scenes and complex trajectories through simulated environments, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLFF while reducing runtime by two to four times compared to the most efficient competing method.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), known for its groundbreaking performance and efficiency, has become a dominant 3D representation and brought progress to many 3D vision tasks. However, in this work, we reveal a significant security vulnerability that has been largely overlooked in 3DGS: the computation cost of training 3DGS could be maliciously tampered by poisoning the input data. By developing an attack named Poison-splat, we reveal a novel attack surface where the adversary can poison the input images to drastically increase the computation memory and time needed for 3DGS training, pushing the algorithm towards its worst computation complexity. In extreme cases, the attack can even consume all allocable memory, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) that disrupts servers, resulting in practical damages to real-world 3DGS service vendors. Such a computation cost attack is achieved by addressing a bi-level optimization problem through three tailored strategies: attack objective approximation, proxy model rendering, and optional constrained optimization. These strategies not only ensure the effectiveness of our attack but also make it difficult to defend with simple defensive measures. We hope the revelation of this novel attack surface can spark attention to this crucial yet overlooked vulnerability of 3DGS systems.",

Leveraging a subject-specific dataset containing diverse facial expressions captured under various lighting conditions, including flat-lit and one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) scenarios, we train a diffusion model for precise lighting control, enabling high-fidelity relit facial images from flat-lit inputs. Our framework includes spatially-aligned conditioning of flat-lit captures and random noise, along with integrated lighting information for global control, utilizing prior knowledge from the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. This model is then applied to dynamic facial performances captured in a consistent flat-lit environment and reconstructed for novel-view synthesis using a scalable dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting method to maintain quality and consistency in the relit results. In addition, we introduce unified lighting control by integrating a novel area lighting representation with directional lighting, allowing for joint adjustments in light size and direction. We also enable high dynamic range imaging (HDRI) composition using multiple directional lights to produce dynamic sequences under complex lighting conditions. Our evaluations demonstrate the models efficiency in achieving precise lighting control and generalizing across various facial expressions while preserving detailed features such as skintexture andhair. The model accurately reproduces complex lighting effects like eye reflections, subsurface scattering, self-shadowing, and translucency, advancing photorealism within our framework.",

Current 3D generation methods utilizing NeRF or 3D-GS as representations for 3D objects, generate a Lambertian object under fixed lighting and lack separated modelings for material and global illumination. As a result, the generated assets are unsuitable for relighting under varying lighting conditions, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel relightable 3D object generative framework that automates the creation of 3D car assets, enabling the swift and accurate reconstruction of a vehicle's geometry, texture, and material properties from a single input image. Our approach begins with introducing a large-scale synthetic car dataset comprising over 1,000 high-precision 3D vehicle models. We represent 3D objects using global illumination and relightable 3D Gaussian primitives integrating with BRDF parameters. Building on this representation, we introduce a feed-forward model that takes images as input and outputs both relightable 3D Gaussians and global illumination parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces photorealistic 3D car assets that can be seamlessly integrated into road scenes with different illuminations, which offers substantial practical benefits for industrial applications.",

We propose the Neural Material Adaptor (NeuMA), which integrates existing physical laws with learned corrections, facilitating accurate learning of actual dynamics while maintaining the generalizability and interpretability of physical priors. Additionally, we propose Particle-GS, a particle-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting variant that bridges simulation and observed images, allowing back-propagate image gradients to optimize the simulator.

In these applications, coherence across camera frames and multiple views is crucial, be it for robust convergence of a scene reconstruction or for artifact-free fly-throughs. Recent work started mitigating artifacts that break multi-view coherence, including popping artifacts due to inconsistent transparency sorting and perspective-correct outlines of (2D) splats. At the same time, real-time requirements forced such implementations to accept compromises in how transparency of large assemblies of 3D Gaussians is resolved, in turn breaking coherence in other ways. In our work, we aim at achieving maximum coherence, by rendering fully perspective-correct 3D Gaussians while using a high-quality approximation of accurate blending, hybrid transparency, on a per-pixel level, in order to retain real-time frame rates. Our fast and perspectively accurate approach for evaluation of 3D Gaussians does not require matrix inversions, thereby ensuring numerical stability and eliminating the need for special handling of degenerate splats, and the hybrid transparency formulation for blending maintains similar quality as fully resolved per-pixel transparencies at a fraction of the rendering costs. We further show that each of these two components can be independently integrated into Gaussian splatting systems. In combination, they achieve up to 2$\\times$ higher frame rates, 2$\\times$ faster optimization, and equal or better image quality with fewer rendering artifacts compared to traditional 3DGS on common benchmarks.",

Compared to frame-based camera, a novel type of bio-inspired visual sensor, i.e. event camera, has demonstrated advantages in high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low power consumption and low latency. Due to its unique asynchronous and irregular data capturing process, limited work has been proposed to apply neural representation or 3D Gaussian splatting for an event camera. In this work, we present IncEventGS, an incremental 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction algorithm with a single event camera. To recover the 3D scene representation incrementally, we exploit the tracking and mapping paradigm of conventional SLAM pipelines for IncEventGS. Given the incoming event stream, the tracker firstly estimates an initial camera motion based on prior reconstructed 3D-GS scene representation. The mapper then jointly refines both the 3D scene representation and camera motion based on the previously estimated motion trajectory from the tracker. The experimental results demonstrate that IncEventGS delivers superior performance compared to prior NeRF-based methods and other related baselines, even we do not have the ground-truth camera poses. Furthermore, our method can also deliver better performance compared to state-of-the-art event visual odometry methods in terms of camera motion estimation.

Although various compression techniques have been proposed, previous art suffers from a common limitation: for any existing 3DGS, per-scene optimization is needed to achieve compression, making the compression sluggish and slow. To address this issue, we introduce Fast Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting (FCGS), an optimization-free model that can compress 3DGS representations rapidly in a single feed-forward pass, which significantly reduces compression time from minutes to seconds. To enhance compression efficiency, we propose a multi-path entropy module that assigns Gaussian attributes to different entropy constraint paths for balance between size and fidelity. We also carefully design both inter- and intra-Gaussian context models to remove redundancies among the unstructured Gaussian blobs. Overall, FCGS achieves a compression ratio of over 20X while maintaining fidelity, surpassing most per-scene SOTA optimization-based methods.

Although subsequent efforts rapidly extend static 3D Gaussian to dynamic scenes, they often lack explicit constraints on object motion, leading to optimization difficulties and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose a novel deformable 3D Gaussian splatting framework called MotionGS, which explores explicit motion priors to guide the deformation of 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we first introduce an optical flow decoupling module that decouples optical flow into camera flow and motion flow, corresponding to camera movement and object motion respectively. Then the motion flow can effectively constrain the deformation of 3D Gaussians, thus simulating the motion of dynamic objects. Additionally, a camera pose refinement module is proposed to alternately optimize 3D Gaussians and camera poses, mitigating the impact of inaccurate camera poses. Extensive experiments in the monocular dynamic scenes validate that MotionGS surpasses state-of-the-art methods and exhibits significant superiority in both qualitative and quantitative results.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in 2D/3D generative techniques have facilitated the generation of dynamic 3D objects from monocular videos. Previous methods mainly rely on the implicit neural radiance fields (NeRF) or explicit Gaussian Splatting as the underlying representation, and struggle to achieve satisfactory spatial-temporal consistency and surface appearance. Drawing inspiration from modern 3D animation pipelines, we introduce DreamMesh4D, a novel framework combining mesh representation with geometric skinning technique to generate high-quality 4D object from a monocular video. Instead of utilizing classical texture map for appearance, we bind Gaussian splats to triangle face of mesh for differentiable optimization of both the texture and mesh vertices. In particular, DreamMesh4D begins with a coarse mesh obtained through an image-to-3D generation procedure. Sparse points are then uniformly sampled across the mesh surface, and are used to build a deformation graph to drive the motion of the 3D object for the sake of computational efficiency and providing additional constraint. For each step, transformations of sparse control points are predicted using a deformation network, and the mesh vertices as well as the surface Gaussians are deformed via a novel geometric skinning algorithm, which is a hybrid approach combining LBS (linear blending skinning) and DQS (dual-quaternion skinning), mitigating drawbacks associated with both approaches. The static surface Gaussians and mesh vertices as well as the deformation network are learned via reference view photometric loss, score distillation loss as well as other regularizers in a two-stage manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of our method. Furthermore, our method is compatible with modern graphic pipelines, showcasing its potential in the 3D gaming and film industry.",

Traditional LiDAR-based mapping provides high precision but is costly, heavy, and power-intensive, with limited ability for novel view rendering. Vision-based mapping, while cost-effective and capable of capturing visual data, often struggles with high-quality 3D reconstruction due to sparse point clouds. We propose ES-Gaussian, an end-to-end system using a low-altitude camera and single-line LiDAR for high-quality 3D indoor reconstruction. Our system features Visual Error Construction (VEC) to enhance sparse point clouds by identifying and correcting areas with insufficient geometric detail from 2D error maps. Additionally, we introduce a novel 3DGS initialization method guided by single-line LiDAR, overcoming the limitations of traditional multi-view setups and enabling effective reconstruction in resource-constrained environments. Extensive experimental results on our new Dreame-SR dataset and a publicly available dataset demonstrate that ES-Gaussian outperforms existing methods, particularly in challenging scenarios.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting is capable of reconstructing 3D scenes in minutes. Despite recent advances in improving surface reconstruction accuracy, the reconstructed results still exhibit bias and suffer from inefficiency in storage and training. This paper provides a different observation on the cause of the inefficiency and the reconstruction bias, which is attributed to the integration of the low-opacity parts (LOPs) of the generated Gaussians. We show that LOPs consist of Gaussians with overall low-opacity (LOGs) and the low-opacity tails (LOTs) of Gaussians. We propose Spiking GS to reduce such two types of LOPs by integrating spiking neurons into the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. Specifically, we introduce global and local full-precision integrate-and-fire spiking neurons to the opacity and representation function of flattened 3D Gaussians, respectively. Furthermore, we enhance the density control strategy with spiking neurons' thresholds and a new criterion on the scale of Gaussians. Our method can represent more accurate reconstructed surfaces at a lower cost. The supplementary material and code are available at https://github.com/zju-bmi-lab/SpikingGS.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D scenes from multiple viewpoints is a fundamental task in stereo vision. Recently, advances in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting have enabled high-quality novel view synthesis for unseen scenes from sparse input views by feed-forward predicting per-pixel Gaussian parameters without extra optimization. However, existing methods typically generate single-scale 3D Gaussians, which lack representation of both large-scale structure and texture details, resulting in mislocation and artefacts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, HiSplat, which introduces a hierarchical manner in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct hierarchical 3D Gaussians via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Specifically, HiSplat generates large coarse-grained Gaussians to capture large-scale structures, followed by fine-grained Gaussians to enhance delicate texture details. To promote inter-scale interactions, we propose an Error Aware Module for Gaussian compensation and a Modulating Fusion Module for Gaussian repair. Our method achieves joint optimization of hierarchical representations, allowing for novel view synthesis using only two-view reference images. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that HiSplat significantly enhances reconstruction quality and cross-dataset generalization compared to prior single-scale methods. The corresponding ablation study and analysis of different-scale 3D Gaussians reveal the mechanism behind the effectiveness. Project website: https://open3dvlab.github.io/HiSplat/",

The results show that our approach succeeds at visual localization in challenging conditions of relatively small overlap between initial and target frames inside textureless environments when state-of-the-art neural sparse methods provide inferior results.

We contribute a novel framework, SplaTraj, which formulates the generation of images within photorealistic environment representations as a continuous-time trajectory optimization problem. Costs are designed so that a camera following the trajectory poses will smoothly traverse through the environment and render the specified spatial information in a photogenic manner. This is achieved by querying a photorealistic representation with language embedding to isolate regions that correspond to the user-specified inputs. These regions are then projected to the camera's view as it moves over time and a cost is constructed. We can then apply gradient-based optimization and differentiate through the rendering to optimize the trajectory for the defined cost. The resulting trajectory moves to photogenically view each of the specified objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a suite of environments and instructions, and demonstrate the quality of generated image sequences.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient 3D reconstruction of trees is crucial for forest resource assessments and management. Close-Range Photogrammetry (CRP) is commonly used for reconstructing forest scenes but faces challenges like low efficiency and poor quality. Recently, Novel View Synthesis (NVS) technologies, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have shown promise for 3D plant reconstruction with limited images. However, existing research mainly focuses on small plants in orchards or individual trees, leaving uncertainty regarding their application in larger, complex forest stands. In this study, we collected sequential images of forest plots with varying complexity and performed dense reconstruction using NeRF and 3DGS. The resulting point clouds were compared with those from photogrammetry and laser scanning. Results indicate that NVS methods significantly enhance reconstruction efficiency. Photogrammetry struggles with complex stands, leading to point clouds with excessive canopy noise and incorrectly reconstructed trees, such as duplicated trunks. NeRF, while better for canopy regions, may produce errors in ground areas with limited views. The 3DGS method generates sparser point clouds, particularly in trunk areas, affecting diameter at breast height (DBH) accuracy. All three methods can extract tree height information, with NeRF yielding the highest accuracy; however, photogrammetry remains superior for DBH accuracy. These findings suggest that NVS methods have significant potential for 3D reconstruction of forest stands, offering valuable support for complex forest resource inventory and visualization tasks.",

Existing approaches for NeRF either introduce significant computational overhead (e.g., ``10x increase in training time\" or ``10x repeated training\") or are limited to specific uncertainty conditions or models. Notably, GS models lack any systematic approach for comprehensive epistemic UQ. This capability is crucial for improving the robustness and scalability of neural view synthesis, enabling active model updates, error estimation, and scalable ensemble modeling based on uncertainty. In this paper, we revisit NeRF and GS-based methods from a function approximation perspective, identifying key differences and connections in 3D representation learning. Building on these insights, we introduce PH-Dropout (Post hoc Dropout), the first real-time and accurate method for epistemic uncertainty estimation that operates directly on pre-trained NeRF and GS models.

Despite recent advances in text-guided 3D scene editing, integrating 2D VTON into these pipelines to achieve vivid 3D VTON remains challenging. The reasons are twofold. First, text prompts cannot provide sufficient details in describing clothing. Second, 2D VTON results generated from different viewpoints of the same 3D scene lack coherence and spatial relationships, hence frequently leading to appearance inconsistencies and geometric distortions. To resolve these problems, we introduce an image-prompted 3D VTON method (dubbed GS-VTON) which, by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as the 3D representation, enables the transfer of pre-trained knowledge from 2D VTON models to 3D while improving cross-view consistency. (1) Specifically, we propose a personalized diffusion model that utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning to incorporate personalized information into pre-trained 2D VTON models. To achieve effective LoRA training, we introduce a reference-driven image editing approach that enables the simultaneous editing of multi-view images while ensuring consistency. (2) Furthermore, we propose a persona-aware 3DGS editing framework to facilitate effective editing while maintaining consistent cross-view appearance and high-quality 3D geometry.

Although recent advancements, such as the use of reconstructed mesh and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), have made progress in simulating the physical properties of LiDAR, these methods have struggled to achieve satisfactory frame rates and rendering quality. To address these limitations, we present LiDAR-GS, the first LiDAR Gaussian Splatting method, for real-time high-fidelity re-simulation of LiDAR sensor scans in public urban road scenes. The vanilla Gaussian Splatting, designed for camera models, cannot be directly applied to LiDAR re-simulation. To bridge the gap between passive camera and active LiDAR, our LiDAR-GS designs a differentiable laser beam splatting, grounded in the LiDAR range view model. This innovation allows for precise surface splatting by projecting lasers onto micro cross-sections, effectively eliminating artifacts associated with local affine approximations. Additionally, LiDAR-GS leverages Neural Gaussian Fields, which further integrate view-dependent clues, to represent key LiDAR properties that are influenced by the incident angle and external factors. Combining these practices with some essential adaptations, e.g., dynamic instances decomposition, our approach succeeds in simultaneously re-simulating depth, intensity, and ray-drop channels, achieving state-of-the-art results in both rendering frame rate and quality on publically available large scene datasets.

Advances in photorealistic environment models have enabled robots to develop hyper-realistic reconstructions, which can be used to generate images that are intuitive for human inspection. In particular, the recently introduced \\ac{3DGS}, which describes the scene with up to millions of primitive ellipsoids, can be rendered in real time. \\ac{3DGS} has rapidly gained prominence. However, a critical unsolved problem persists: how can we fuse multiple \\ac{3DGS} into a single coherent model? Solving this problem will enable robot teams to jointly build \\ac{3DGS} models of their surroundings. A key insight of this work is to leverage the {duality} between photorealistic reconstructions, which render realistic 2D images from 3D structure, and \\emph{3D foundation models}, which predict 3D structure from image pairs. To this end, we develop PhotoReg, a framework to register multiple photorealistic \\ac{3DGS} models with 3D foundation models. As \\ac{3DGS} models are generally built from monocular camera images, they have \\emph{arbitrary scale}. To resolve this, PhotoReg actively enforces scale consistency among the different \\ac{3DGS} models by considering depth estimates within these models. Then, the alignment is iteratively refined with fine-grained photometric losses to produce high-quality fused \\ac{3DGS} models. We rigorously evaluate PhotoReg on both standard benchmark datasets and our custom-collected datasets, including with two quadruped robots. The code is released at \\url{ziweny11.github.io/photoreg}.",

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis has advanced significantly with the development of neural radiance fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). However, achieving high quality without compromising real-time rendering remains challenging, particularly for physically-based ray tracing with view-dependent effects. Recently, N-dimensional Gaussians (N-DG) introduced a 6D spatial-angular representation to better incorporate view-dependent effects, but the Gaussian representation and control scheme are sub-optimal. In this paper, we revisit 6D Gaussians and introduce 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS), which enhances color and opacity representations and leverages the additional directional information in the 6D space for optimized Gaussian control. Our approach is fully compatible with the 3DGS framework and significantly improves real-time radiance field rendering by better modeling view-dependent effects and fine details. Experiments demonstrate that 6DGS significantly outperforms 3DGS and N-DG, achieving up to a 15.73 dB improvement in PSNR with a reduction of 66.5% Gaussian points compared to 3DGS.

However, in real-world, online robotic scenes where the number of views is limited given efficiency requirements, random view selection for 3DGS becomes impractical as views are often overlapping and redundant. We address this issue by proposing an end-to-end online training and active view selection pipeline, which enhances the performance of 3DGS in few-view robotics settings. We first elevate the performance of few-shot 3DGS with a novel semantic depth alignment method using Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) that we supplement with Pearson depth and surface normal loss to improve color and depth reconstruction of real-world scenes. We then extend FisherRF, a next-best-view selection method for 3DGS, to select views and touch poses based on depth uncertainty. We perform online view selection on a real robot system during live 3DGS training. We motivate our improvements to few-shot GS scenes, and extend depth-based FisherRF to them, where we demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements on challenging robot scenes.

Our method integrates pixel-aligned anchors from monocular depths and generates Gaussian splats around these anchors using residual-form Gaussian decoders.

Despite recent advancements, existing surface reconstruction methods, which are primarily designed for object-centric scenarios, struggle to adapt effectively to the unique characteristics of street scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce StreetSurfGS, the first method to employ Gaussian Splatting specifically tailored for scalable urban street scene surface reconstruction. StreetSurfGS utilizes a planar-based octree representation and segmented training to reduce memory costs, accommodate unique camera characteristics, and ensure scalability. Additionally, to mitigate depth inaccuracies caused by object overlap, we propose a guided smoothing strategy within regularization to eliminate inaccurate boundary points and outliers. Furthermore, to address sparse views and multi-scale challenges, we use a dual-step matching strategy that leverages adjacent and long-term information. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of StreetSurfGS in both novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction.",

To address this limitation, we propose Variational Bayes Gaussian Splatting (VBGS), a novel approach that frames training a Gaussian splat as variational inference over model parameters. By leveraging the conjugacy properties of multivariate Gaussians, we derive a closed-form variational update rule, allowing efficient updates from partial, sequential observations without the need for replay buffers. Our experiments show that VBGS not only matches state-of-the-art performance on static datasets, but also enables continual learning from sequentially streamed 2D and 3D data, drastically improving performance in this setting.",

    "abstract": "We present GI-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and deferred shading to achieve photo-realistic novel view synthesis and relighting. In inverse rendering, accurately modeling the shading processes of objects is essential for achieving high-fidelity results. Therefore, it is critical to incorporate global illumination to account for indirect lighting that reaches an object after multiple bounces across the scene. Previous 3DGS-based methods have attempted to model indirect lighting by characterizing indirect illumination as learnable lighting volumes or additional attributes of each Gaussian, while using baked occlusion to represent shadow effects. These methods, however, fail to accurately model the complex physical interactions between light and objects, making it impossible to construct realistic indirect illumination during relighting. To address this limitation, we propose to calculate indirect lighting using efficient path tracing with deferred shading. In our framework, we first render a G-buffer to capture the detailed geometry and material properties of the scene. Then, we perform physically-based rendering (PBR) only for direct lighting. With the G-buffer and previous rendering results, the indirect lighting can be calculated through a lightweight path tracing. Our method effectively models indirect lighting under any given lighting conditions, thereby achieving better novel view synthesis and relighting. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our GI-GS outperforms existing baselines in both rendering quality and efficiency.",

To address this issue, we propose Super-Resolution 3DGS (SuperGS), which is an expansion of 3DGS designed with a two-stage coarse-to-fine training framework. In this framework, we use a latent feature field to represent the low-resolution scene, serving as both the initialization and foundational information for super-resolution optimization.

Rendering on top of an explicit representation, the vanilla 3DGS and its variants deliver real-time efficiency by optimizing the parametric model with single-view supervision per iteration during training which is adopted from NeRF. Consequently, certain views are overfitted, leading to unsatisfying appearance in novel-view synthesis and imprecise 3D geometries. To solve aforementioned problems, we propose a new 3DGS optimization method embodying four key novel contributions: 1) We transform the conventional single-view training paradigm into a multi-view training strategy. With our proposed multi-view regulation, 3D Gaussian attributes are further optimized without overfitting certain training views. As a general solution, we improve the overall accuracy in a variety of scenarios and different Gaussian variants. 2) Inspired by the benefit introduced by additional views, we further propose a cross-intrinsic guidance scheme, leading to a coarse-to-fine training procedure concerning different resolutions. 3) Built on top of our multi-view regulated training, we further propose a cross-ray densification strategy, densifying more Gaussian kernels in the ray-intersect regions from a selection of views. 4) By further investigating the densification strategy, we found that the effect of densification should be enhanced when certain views are distinct dramatically. As a solution, we propose a novel multi-view augmented densification strategy, where 3D Gaussians are encouraged to get densified to a sufficient number accordingly, resulting in improved reconstruction accuracy.",

As such, unlike 3DGS our formulation does not suffer from popping artifacts and view dependent density, but still achieves frame rates of $\\sim\\!30$ FPS at 720p on an NVIDIA RTX4090.

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are widely used for novel-view synthesis and have been adapted for 3D Object Detection (3DOD), offering a promising approach to 3DOD through view-synthesis representation. However, NeRF faces inherent limitations: (i) limited representational capacity for 3DOD due to its implicit nature, and (ii) slow rendering speeds. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an explicit 3D representation that addresses these limitations. Inspired by these advantages, this paper introduces 3DGS into 3DOD for the first time, identifying two main challenges: (i) Ambiguous spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs: 3DGS primarily relies on 2D pixel-level supervision, resulting in unclear 3D spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs and poor differentiation between objects and background, which hinders 3DOD; (ii) Excessive background blobs: 2D images often include numerous background pixels, leading to densely reconstructed 3DGS with many noisy Gaussian blobs representing the background, negatively affecting detection. To tackle the challenge (i), we leverage the fact that 3DGS reconstruction is derived from 2D images, and propose an elegant and efficient solution by incorporating 2D Boundary Guidance to significantly enhance the spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs, resulting in clearer differentiation between objects and their background. To address the challenge (ii), we propose a Box-Focused Sampling strategy using 2D boxes to generate object probability distribution in 3D spaces, allowing effective probabilistic sampling in 3D to retain more object blobs and reduce noisy background blobs. Benefiting from our designs, our 3DGS-DET significantly outperforms the SOTA NeRF-based method, NeRF-Det, achieving improvements of +6.6 on mAP@0.25 and +8.1 on mAP@0.5 for the ScanNet dataset, and impressive +31.5 on mAP@0.25 for the ARKITScenes dataset.",

Our paper presents a novel method aimed at obtaining high-quality multi-view consistent reflection rendering by modelling reflections as physically-based virtual cameras. We estimate mirror planes with depth and normal estimates from 3D-GS and define virtual cameras that are placed symmetrically about the mirror plane. These virtual cameras are then used to explain mirror reflections in the scene. To address imperfections in mirror plane estimates, we propose a straightforward yet effective virtual camera optimization method to enhance reflection quality. We collect a new mirror dataset including three real-world scenarios for more diverse evaluation. Experimental validation on both Mirror-Nerf and our real-world dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We achieve comparable or superior results while significantly reducing training time compared to previous state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Recently, with the development of Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting, 3D reconstruction techniques have achieved remarkably high fidelity. However, the latent representations learnt by these methods are highly entangled and lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel part-aware compositional reconstruction method, called GaussianBlock, that enables semantically coherent and disentangled representations, allowing for precise and physical editing akin to building blocks, while simultaneously maintaining high fidelity. Our GaussianBlock introduces a hybrid representation that leverages the advantages of both primitives, known for their flexible actionability and editability, and 3D Gaussians, which excel in reconstruction quality. Specifically, we achieve semantically coherent primitives through a novel attention-guided centering loss derived from 2D semantic priors, complemented by a dynamic splitting and fusion strategy. Furthermore, we utilize 3D Gaussians that hybridize with primitives to refine structural details and enhance fidelity. Additionally, a binding inheritance strategy is employed to strengthen and maintain the connection between the two. Our reconstructed scenes are evidenced to be disentangled, compositional, and compact across diverse benchmarks, enabling seamless, direct and precise editing while maintaining high quality.",

Traditional image-based INRs employ neural networks to map pixel coordinates to RGB values, capturing shapes, colors, and textures within the network's weights. Recently, GaussianImage has been proposed as an alternative, using Gaussian functions instead of neural networks to achieve comparable quality and compression. Such a solution obtains a quality and compression ratio similar to classical INR models but does not allow image modification. In contrast, our work introduces a novel method, MiraGe, which uses mirror reflections to perceive 2D images in 3D space and employs flat-controlled Gaussians for precise 2D image editing. Our approach improves the rendering quality and allows realistic image modifications, including human-inspired perception of photos in the 3D world. Thanks to modeling images in 3D space, we obtain the illusion of 3D-based modification in 2D images. We also show that our Gaussian representation can be easily combined with a physics engine to produce physics-based modification of 2D images. Consequently, MiraGe allows for better quality than the standard approach and natural modification of 2D images.",

To overcome these, we introduce a novel Gaussian Splatting-based method, UW-GS, designed specifically for underwater applications. It introduces a color appearance that models distance-dependent color variation, employs a new physics-based density control strategy to enhance clarity for distant objects, and uses a binary motion mask to handle dynamic content. Optimized with a well-designed loss function supporting for scattering media and strengthened by pseudo-depth maps, UW-GS outperforms existing methods with PSNR gains up to 1.26dB.

Specifically, we first introduce an Efficient cross-View Attention (EVA) module to accurately estimate the position of each 3D Gaussian from the source images. Then, we integrate the source images with the estimated Gaussian position map to predict the attributes and feature embeddings of the 3D Gaussians. Moreover, we employ a recurrent feature refiner to correct artifacts caused by geometric errors in position estimation and enhance visual fidelity.To further improve synthesis quality, we incorporate a powerful anchor loss function for both 3D Gaussian attributes and human face landmarks.

In this paper, we propose Gaussian-Det which leverages Gaussian Splatting as surface representation for multi-view based 3D object detection. Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface closure of the object proposal. In this way, the surface information Gaussian-Det exploits serves as the prior on the quality and reliability of objectness and the information basis of proposal refinement. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Gaussian-Det outperforms various existing approaches, in terms of both average precision and recall.",

    "abstract": "Generating high-quality 3D content from text, single images, or sparse view images remains a challenging task with broad applications. Existing methods typically employ multi-view diffusion models to synthesize multi-view images, followed by a feed-forward process for 3D reconstruction. However, these approaches are often constrained by a small and fixed number of input views, limiting their ability to capture diverse viewpoints and, even worse, leading to suboptimal generation results if the synthesized views are of poor quality. To address these limitations, we propose Flex3D, a novel two-stage framework capable of leveraging an arbitrary number of high-quality input views. The first stage consists of a candidate view generation and curation pipeline. We employ a fine-tuned multi-view image diffusion model and a video diffusion model to generate a pool of candidate views, enabling a rich representation of the target 3D object. Subsequently, a view selection pipeline filters these views based on quality and consistency, ensuring that only the high-quality and reliable views are used for reconstruction. In the second stage, the curated views are fed into a Flexible Reconstruction Model (FlexRM), built upon a transformer architecture that can effectively process an arbitrary number of inputs. FlemRM directly outputs 3D Gaussian points leveraging a tri-plane representation, enabling efficient and detailed 3D generation. Through extensive exploration of design and training strategies, we optimize FlexRM to achieve superior performance in both reconstruction and generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that Flex3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a user study winning rate of over 92% in 3D generation tasks when compared to several of the latest feed-forward 3D generative models.",

To this end, we propose 3DGR-CAR, a 3D Gaussian Representation for Coronary Artery Reconstruction from ultra-sparse X-ray projections. We leverage 3D Gaussian representation to avoid the inefficiency caused by the extreme sparsity of coronary artery data and propose a Gaussian center predictor to overcome the noisy Gaussian initialization from ultra-sparse view projections.

The clinical workflow of arthroscopy typically involves inserting an arthroscope into the joint through a small incision, during which surgeons navigate and operate largely by relying on their visual assessment through the arthroscope. However, the arthroscope's restricted field of view and lack of depth perception pose challenges in navigating complex articular structures and achieving surgical precision during procedures. Aiming at enhancing intraoperative awareness, we present a robust pipeline that incorporates simultaneous localization and mapping, depth estimation, and 3D Gaussian splatting to realistically reconstruct intra-articular structures solely based on monocular arthroscope video. Extending 3D reconstruction to Augmented Reality (AR) applications, our solution offers AR assistance for articular notch measurement and annotation anchoring in a human-in-the-loop manner. Compared to traditional Structure-from-Motion and Neural Radiance Field-based methods, our pipeline achieves dense 3D reconstruction and competitive rendering fidelity with explicit 3D representation in 7 minutes on average. When evaluated on four phantom datasets, our method achieves RMSE = 2.21mm reconstruction error, PSNR = 32.86 and SSIM = 0.89 on average. Because our pipeline enables AR reconstruction and guidance directly from monocular arthroscopy without any additional data and/or hardware, our solution may hold the potential for enhancing intraoperative awareness and facilitating surgical precision in arthroscopy. Our AR measurement tool achieves accuracy within 1.59 +/- 1.81mm and the AR annotation tool achieves a mIoU of 0.721.",

Prior work in human reconstruction is either limited to tight clothing with no object interactions, or requires calibrated multi-view captures or personalized template scans which are costly to collect at scale. Our key insight for high-quality yet flexible reconstruction is the careful combination of generic human priors about articulated body shape (learned from large-scale training data) with video-specific articulated \"bag-of-bones\" deformation (fit to a single video via test-time optimization). We accomplish this by learning a neural implicit model that disentangles body versus clothing deformations as separate motion model layers. To capture subtle geometry of clothing, we leverage image-based priors such as human body pose, surface normals, and optical flow during optimization. The resulting neural fields can be extracted into time-consistent meshes, or further optimized as explicit 3D Gaussians for high-fidelity interactive rendering. On datasets with highly challenging clothing deformations and object interactions, DressRecon yields higher-fidelity 3D reconstructions than prior art.

However, current Gaussian Splatting SLAM methods, designed mainly for hand-held RGB or RGB-D sensors, struggle with tracking drifts when used with rotating RGB-D camera setups. In this paper, we propose a robust Gaussian Splatting SLAM architecture that utilizes inputs from rotating multiple RGB-D cameras to achieve accurate localization and photorealistic rendering performance. The carefully designed Gaussian Splatting Loop Closure module effectively addresses the issue of accumulated tracking and mapping errors found in conventional Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems. First, each Gaussian is associated with an anchor frame and categorized as historical or novel based on its timestamp. By rendering different types of Gaussians at the same viewpoint, the proposed loop detection strategy considers both co-visibility relationships and distinct rendering outcomes. Furthermore, a loop closure optimization approach is proposed to remove camera pose drift and maintain the high quality of 3D Gaussian models. The approach uses a lightweight pose graph optimization algorithm to correct pose drift and updates Gaussians based on the optimized poses. Additionally, a bundle adjustment scheme further refines camera poses using photometric and geometric constraints, ultimately enhancing the global consistency of scenarios. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in camera pose estimation and novel view rendering tasks.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown impressive results for the novel view synthesis task, where lighting is assumed to be fixed. However, creating relightable 3D assets, especially for objects with ill-defined shapes (fur, fabric, etc.), remains a challenging task. The decomposition between light, geometry, and material is ambiguous, especially if either smooth surface assumptions or surfacebased analytical shading models do not apply. We propose Relightable Neural Gaussians (RNG), a novel 3DGS-based framework that enables the relighting of objects with both hard surfaces or soft boundaries, while avoiding assumptions on the shading model. We condition the radiance at each point on both view and light directions. We also introduce a shadow cue, as well as a depth refinement network to improve shadow accuracy. Finally, we propose a hybrid forward-deferred fitting strategy to balance geometry and appearance quality. Our method achieves significantly faster training (1.3 hours) and rendering (60 frames per second) compared to a prior method based on neural radiance fields and produces higher-quality shadows than a concurrent 3DGS-based method.",

    "abstract": "Large scale 3D scene reconstruction is important for applications such as virtual reality and simulation. Existing neural rendering approaches (e.g., NeRF, 3DGS) have achieved realistic reconstructions on large scenes, but optimize per scene, which is expensive and slow, and exhibit noticeable artifacts under large view changes due to overfitting. Generalizable approaches or large reconstruction models are fast, but primarily work for small scenes/objects and often produce lower quality rendering results. In this work, we introduce G3R, a generalizable reconstruction approach that can efficiently predict high-quality 3D scene representations for large scenes. We propose to learn a reconstruction network that takes the gradient feedback signals from differentiable rendering to iteratively update a 3D scene representation, combining the benefits of high photorealism from per-scene optimization with data-driven priors from fast feed-forward prediction methods. Experiments on urban-driving and drone datasets show that G3R generalizes across diverse large scenes and accelerates the reconstruction process by at least 10x while achieving comparable or better realism compared to 3DGS, and also being more robust to large view changes.",

This paper explores the use of event cameras for motion tracking thereby providing a solution with inherent robustness under difficult dynamics and illumination. In order to circumvent the challenge of event camera-based mapping, the solution is framed in a cross-modal way. It tracks a map representation that comes directly from frame-based cameras. Specifically, the proposed method operates on top of gaussian splatting, a state-of-the-art representation that permits highly efficient and realistic novel view synthesis. The key of our approach consists of a novel pose parametrization that uses a reference pose plus first order dynamics for local differential image rendering. The latter is then compared against images of integrated events in a staggered coarse-to-fine optimization scheme. As demonstrated by our results, the realistic view rendering ability of gaussian splatting leads to stable and accurate tracking across a variety of both publicly available and newly recorded data sequences.",

This task is particularly challenging due to the significant occlusion and dynamic contact between the hands and the object during bimanual manipulation. We worked to resolve these issues by introducing a mask loss and a 3D contact loss, respectively. Moreover, we applied 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to this task. As a result, our method achieved a value of 38.69 in the main metric, CD$_h$, on the ARCTIC test set.",

To tackle the dynamic contents and the occlusions in complex scenes, we present a space-time 2D Gaussian Splatting approach. Specifically, to improve geometric quality in dynamic scenes, we learn canonical 2D Gaussian splats and deform these 2D Gaussian splats while enforcing the disks of the Gaussian located on the surface of the objects by introducing depth and normal regularizers. Further, to tackle the occlusion issues in complex scenes, we introduce a compositional opacity deformation strategy, which further reduces the surface recovery of those occluded areas.

We present a mapping system that incrementally builds a Language-Embedded Gaussian Splat (LEGS): a detailed 3D scene representation that encodes both appearance and semantics in a unified representation. LEGS is trained online as a robot traverses its environment to enable localization of open-vocabulary object queries. We evaluate LEGS on 4 room-scale scenes where we query for objects in the scene to assess how LEGS can capture semantic meaning. We compare LEGS to LERF and find that while both systems have comparable object query success rates, LEGS trains over 3.5x faster than LERF. Results suggest that a multi-camera setup and incremental bundle adjustment can boost visual reconstruction quality in constrained robot trajectories, and suggest LEGS can localize open-vocabulary and long-tail object queries with up to 66% accuracy.",

Existing approaches demonstrate proficiency in transferring colors and textures but often struggle with replicating the geometry of the scenes. In our work, we leverage an explicit Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation and directly match the distributions of Gaussians between style and content scenes using the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). By employing the entropy-regularized Wasserstein-2 distance, we ensure that the transformation maintains spatial smoothness. Additionally, we decompose the scene stylization problem into smaller chunks to enhance efficiency. This paradigm shift reframes stylization from a pure generative process driven by latent space losses to an explicit matching of distributions between two Gaussian representations. Our method achieves high-resolution 3D stylization by faithfully transferring details from 3D style scenes onto the content scene. Furthermore, WaSt-3D consistently delivers results across diverse content and style scenes without necessitating any training, as it relies solely on optimization-based techniques.

Furthermore, the framework features an optimal path generation module that calculates efficient navigation paths for robots toward queried objects, considering obstacles and environmental uncertainties.

Existing methods, which rely on SDS optimization or single-view inpainting, often struggle to produce high-quality results. To address this, we propose a novel method for object insertion in 3D content represented by Gaussian Splatting. Our approach introduces a multi-view diffusion model, dubbed MVInpainter, which is built upon a pre-trained stable video diffusion model to facilitate view-consistent object inpainting. Within MVInpainter, we incorporate a ControlNet-based conditional injection module to enable controlled and more predictable multi-view generation. After generating the multi-view inpainted results, we further propose a mask-aware 3D reconstruction technique to refine Gaussian Splatting reconstruction from these sparse inpainted views. By leveraging these fabricate techniques, our approach yields diverse results, ensures view-consistent and harmonious insertions, and produces better object quality.

Despite this success, they have seen only limited use in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. Two key factors have contributed to this limited success. First, it is challenging to reason about collisions in radiance models. Second, it is difficult to perform inference of radiance models fast enough for real-time trajectory synthesis. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer that operates in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method for rigorously upper-bounding the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Second, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables the efficient computation of the collision bound in a Gaussian Splat. Third, a method is presented to optimize trajectories while avoiding collisions with a scene represented by a Gaussian Splat. Experiments demonstrate that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in highly cluttered environments.

Current state-of-the-art methods are specialized in recovering un-braided 3D hairs and often take braided styles as their failure cases, because of the inherent difficulty to define priors for complex hairstyles, whether rule-based or data-based. We propose a novel strategy to enable single-view 3D reconstruction for a variety of hair types via a unified pipeline. To achieve this, we first collect a large-scale synthetic multi-view hair dataset SynMvHair with diverse 3D hair in both braided and un-braided styles, and learn two diffusion priors specialized on hair. Then we optimize 3D Gaussian-based hair from the priors with two specially designed modules, i.e. view-wise and pixel-wise Gaussian refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that reconstructing braided and un-braided 3D hair from single-view images via a unified approach is possible and our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in recovering complex hairstyles. It is worth to mention that our method shows good generalization ability to real images, although it learns hair priors from synthetic data.",

Current methods to select views that rely on uncertainties from occlusions, depth ambiguities, or neural network predictions directly are insufficient to handle the issue and struggle to generalize to new scenes.

To address these problems, we present AIR-Embodied, a novel framework that integrates embodied AI agents with large-scale pretrained multi-modal language models to improve active 3DGS reconstruction. AIR-Embodied utilizes a three-stage process: understanding the current reconstruction state via multi-modal prompts, planning tasks with viewpoint selection and interactive actions, and employing closed-loop reasoning to ensure accurate execution. The agent dynamically refines its actions based on discrepancies between the planned and actual outcomes.

However, GS-created 3D environments are often difficult to edit. For scene enhancement or to incorporate 3D assets, segmenting Gaussians by class is essential. Existing segmentation approaches are typically limited to certain types of scenes, e.g., ''circular'' scenes, to determine clear object boundaries. However, this method is ineffective when removing large objects in non-''circling'' scenes such as large outdoor scenes. We propose Semantics-Controlled GS (SCGS), a segmentation-driven GS approach, enabling the separation of large scene parts in uncontrolled, natural environments. SCGS allows scene editing and the extraction of scene parts for VR. Additionally, we introduce a challenging outdoor dataset, overcoming the ''circling'' setup. We outperform the state-of-the-art in visual quality on our dataset and in segmentation quality on the 3D-OVS dataset. We conducted an exploratory user study, comparing a 360-video, plain GS, and SCGS in VR with a fixed viewpoint. In our subsequent main study, users were allowed to move freely, evaluating plain GS and SCGS. Our main study results show that participants clearly prefer SCGS over plain GS. We overall present an innovative approach that surpasses the state-of-the-art both technically and in user experience.",

To address this, we have designed a novel 3D representation that encodes the plenoptic function into sinusoidal function indexed dense volumes. This approach facilitates feature sharing across different locations, improving compactness over traditional spatial voxels. The memory footprint of the dense 3D feature grid can be further reduced using spatial decomposition techniques. This design combines the strengths of spatial hashing functions and voxel decomposition, resulting in a model size as small as 150 KB for each 3D scene. Moreover, PPNG features a lightweight rendering pipeline with only 300 lines of code that decodes its representation into standard GL textures and fragment shaders. This enables real-time rendering using the traditional GL pipeline, ensuring universal compatibility and efficiency across various platforms without additional dependencies.",

These features provide the camera with significant advantages in many computer vision tasks. However, the tasks of novel view synthesis based on spike cameras remain underdeveloped. Although there are existing methods for learning neural radiance fields from spike stream, they either lack robustness in extremely noisy, low-quality lighting conditions or suffer from high computational complexity due to the deep fully connected neural networks and ray marching rendering strategies used in neural radiance fields, making it difficult to recover fine texture details. In contrast, the latest advancements in 3DGS have achieved high-quality real-time rendering by optimizing the point cloud representation into Gaussian ellipsoids. Building on this, we introduce SpikeGS, the method to learn 3D Gaussian fields solely from spike stream. We designed a differentiable spike stream rendering framework based on 3DGS, incorporating noise embedding and spiking neurons. By leveraging the multi-view consistency of 3DGS and the tile-based multi-threaded parallel rendering mechanism, we achieved high-quality real-time rendering results. Additionally, we introduced a spike rendering loss function that generalizes under varying illumination conditions. Our method can reconstruct view synthesis results with fine texture details from a continuous spike stream captured by a moving spike camera, while demonstrating high robustness in extremely noisy low-light scenarios.

However, similar to NeRF, it tends to overfit the train views for lack of constraints. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{MVPGS}, a few-shot NVS method that excavates the multi-view priors based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. We leverage the recent learning-based Multi-view Stereo (MVS) to enhance the quality of geometric initialization for 3DGS. To mitigate overfitting, we propose a forward-warping method for additional appearance constraints conforming to scenes based on the computed geometry. Furthermore, we introduce a view-consistent geometry constraint for Gaussian parameters to facilitate proper optimization convergence and utilize a monocular depth regularization as compensation. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time rendering speed. Project page: https://zezeaaa.github.io/projects/MVPGS/",

    "abstract": "Visual localization plays an important role in the applications of Augmented Reality (AR), which enable AR devices to obtain their 6-DoF pose in the pre-build map in order to render virtual content in real scenes. However, most existing approaches can not perform novel view rendering and require large storage capacities for maps. To overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient visual localization method capable of high-quality rendering with fewer parameters. Specifically, our approach leverages 3D Gaussian primitives as the scene representation. To ensure precise 2D-3D correspondences for pose estimation, we develop an unbiased 3D scene-specific descriptor decoder for Gaussian primitives, distilled from a constructed feature volume. Additionally, we introduce a salient 3D landmark selection algorithm that selects a suitable primitive subset based on the saliency score for localization. We further regularize key Gaussian primitives to prevent anisotropic effects, which also improves localization performance. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior or comparable rendering and localization performance to state-of-the-art implicit-based visual localization approaches.

    "abstract": "Experiencing high-fidelity volumetric video as seamlessly as 2D videos is a long-held dream. However, current dynamic 3DGS methods, despite their high rendering quality, face challenges in streaming on mobile devices due to computational and bandwidth constraints. In this paper, we introduce V^3 (Viewing Volumetric Videos), a novel approach that enables high-quality mobile rendering through the streaming of dynamic Gaussians. Our key innovation is to view dynamic 3DGS as 2D videos, facilitating the use of hardware video codecs. Additionally, we propose a two-stage training strategy to reduce storage requirements with rapid training speed. The first stage employs hash encoding and shallow MLP to learn motion, then reduces the number of Gaussians through pruning to meet the streaming requirements, while the second stage fine tunes other Gaussian attributes using residual entropy loss and temporal loss to improve temporal continuity. This strategy, which disentangles motion and appearance, maintains high rendering quality with compact storage requirements. Meanwhile, we designed a multi-platform player to decode and render 2D Gaussian videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of V^3, outperforming other methods by enabling high-quality rendering and streaming on common devices, which is unseen before. As the first to stream dynamic Gaussians on mobile devices, our companion player offers users an unprecedented volumetric video experience, including smooth scrolling and instant sharing.

    "abstract": "Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that output asynchronous and sparse event streams, instead of fixed frames. Benefiting from their distinct advantages, such as high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, event cameras have been applied to address 3D reconstruction, important for robotic mapping. Recently, neural rendering techniques, such as 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have been shown successful in 3D reconstruction. However, it still remains under-explored how to develop an effective event-based 3DGS pipeline. In particular, as 3DGS typically depends on high-quality initialization and dense multiview constraints, a potential problem appears for the 3DGS optimization with events given its inherent sparse property. To this end, we propose a novel event-based 3DGS framework, named Elite-EvGS. Our key idea is to distill the prior knowledge from the off-the-shelf event-to-video (E2V) models to effectively reconstruct 3D scenes from events in a coarse-to-fine optimization manner. Specifically, to address the complexity of 3DGS initialization from events, we introduce a novel warm-up initialization strategy that optimizes a coarse 3DGS from the frames generated by E2V models and then incorporates events to refine the details. Then, we propose a progressive event supervision strategy that employs the window-slicing operation to progressively reduce the number of events used for supervision. This subtly relives the temporal randomness of the event frames, benefiting the optimization of local textural and global structural details. Experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that Elite-EvGS can reconstruct 3D scenes with better textural and structural details. Meanwhile, our method yields plausible performance on the captured real-world data, including diverse challenging conditions, such as fast motion and low light scenes.",

In this paper, we introduce a robust watermarking method for 3D-GS that secures ownership of both the model and its rendered images. Our proposed method remains robust against distortions in rendered images and model attacks while maintaining high rendering quality. To achieve these objectives, we present Frequency-Guided Densification~(FGD), which removes 3D Gaussians based on their contribution to rendering quality, enhancing real-time rendering and the robustness of the message. FGD utilizes Discrete Fourier Transform to split 3D Gaussians in high-frequency areas, improving rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ a gradient mask for 3D Gaussians and design a wavelet-subband loss to enhance rendering quality. Our experiments show that our method embeds the message in the rendered images invisibly and robustly against various attacks, including model distortion.

The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising approach for real-time dense 3D reconstruction. However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems struggle to balance hardware simplicity, speed, and map quality. Most systems excel in one or two of the aforementioned aspects but rarely achieve all. A key issue is the difficulty of initializing 3D Gaussians while concurrently conducting SLAM. To address these challenges, we present Monocular GSO (MGSO), a novel real-time SLAM system that integrates photometric SLAM with 3DGS. Photometric SLAM provides dense structured point clouds for 3DGS initialization, accelerating optimization and producing more efficient maps with fewer Gaussians. As a result, experiments show that our system generates reconstructions with a balance of quality, memory efficiency, and speed that outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our system achieves all results using RGB inputs. We evaluate the Replica, TUM-RGBD, and EuRoC datasets against current live dense reconstruction systems. Not only do we surpass contemporary systems, but experiments also show that we maintain our performance on laptop hardware, making it a practical solution for robotics, A/R, and other real-time applications.",

The representation achieves photorealistic quality by optimizing the position, scale, color, and opacity of thousands to millions of 2D or 3D Gaussian primitives within a scene. However, since each Gaussian primitive encodes both appearance and geometry, these attributes are strongly coupled--thus, high-fidelity appearance modeling requires a large number of Gaussian primitives, even when the scene geometry is simple (e.g., for a textured planar surface). We propose to texture each 2D Gaussian primitive so that even a single Gaussian can be used to capture appearance details. By employing per-primitive texturing, our appearance representation is agnostic to the topology and complexity of the scene's geometry. We show that our approach, GStex, yields improved visual quality over prior work in texturing Gaussian splats. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our decoupling enables improved novel view synthesis performance compared to 2D Gaussian splatting when reducing the number of Gaussian primitives, and that GStex can be used for scene appearance editing and re-texturing.",

Existing methods reduce the optimization time by decreasing the number of Gaussians or by improving the implementation of the differentiable rasterizer. However, they still rely on the ADAM optimizer to fit Gaussian parameters of a scene in thousands of iterations, which can take up to an hour. To this end, we change the optimizer to LM that runs in conjunction with the 3DGS differentiable rasterizer. For efficient GPU parallization, we propose a caching data structure for intermediate gradients that allows us to efficiently calculate Jacobian-vector products in custom CUDA kernels. In every LM iteration, we calculate update directions from multiple image subsets using these kernels and combine them in a weighted mean. Overall, our method is 30% faster than the original 3DGS while obtaining the same reconstruction quality. Our optimization is also agnostic to other methods that acclerate 3DGS, thus enabling even faster speedups compared to vanilla 3DGS.",

    "abstract": "With their meaningful geometry and their omnipresence in the 3D world, edges are extremely useful primitives in computer vision. 3D edges comprise of lines and curves, and methods to reconstruct them use either multi-view images or point clouds as input. State-of-the-art image-based methods first learn a 3D edge point cloud then fit 3D edges to it. The edge point cloud is obtained by learning a 3D neural implicit edge field from which the 3D edge points are sampled on a specific level set (0 or 1). However, such methods present two important drawbacks: i) it is not realistic to sample points on exact level sets due to float imprecision and training inaccuracies. Instead, they are sampled within a range of levels so the points do not lie accurately on the 3D edges and require further processing. ii) Such implicit representations are computationally expensive and require long training times. In this paper, we address these two limitations and propose a 3D edge mapping that is simpler, more efficient, and preserves accuracy. Our method learns explicitly the 3D edge points and their edge direction hence bypassing the need for point sampling. It casts a 3D edge point as the center of a 3D Gaussian and the edge direction as the principal axis of the Gaussian. Such a representation has the advantage of being not only geometrically meaningful but also compatible with the efficient training optimization defined in Gaussian Splatting. Results show that the proposed method produces edges as accurate and complete as the state-of-the-art while being an order of magnitude faster.

For tackling the scalability issue, we split the large scene into multiple cells, and the candidate point-cloud and camera views of each cell are correlated through a visibility-based camera selection and a progressive point-cloud extension. To reinforce the rendering quality, three highlighted improvements are made in comparison with vanilla 3DGS, which are a strategy of the ray-Gaussian intersection and the novel Gaussians density control for learning efficiency, an appearance decoupling module based on ConvKAN network to solve uneven lighting conditions in large-scale scenes, and a refined final loss with the color loss, the depth distortion loss, and the normal consistency loss. Finally, the seamless stitching procedure is executed to merge the individual Gaussian radiance field for novel view synthesis across different cells. Evaluation of Mill19, Urban3D, and MatrixCity datasets shows that our method consistently generates more high-fidelity rendering results than state-of-the-art methods of large-scale scene reconstruction. We further validate the generalizability of the proposed approach by rendering on self-collected video clips recorded by a commercial drone.",

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis, demonstrating high fidelity and efficiency. However, it easily exhibits needle-like artifacts, especially when increasing the sampling rate. Mip-Splatting tries to remove these artifacts with a 3D smoothing filter for frequency constraints and a 2D Mip filter for approximated supersampling. Unfortunately, it tends to produce over-blurred results, and sometimes needle-like Gaussians still persist. Our spectral analysis of the covariance matrix during optimization and densification reveals that current 3D-GS lacks shape awareness, relying instead on spectral radius and view positional gradients to determine splitting. As a result, needle-like Gaussians with small positional gradients and low spectral entropy fail to split and overfit high-frequency details. Furthermore, both the filters used in 3D-GS and Mip-Splatting reduce the spectral entropy and increase the condition number during zooming in to synthesize novel view, causing view inconsistencies and more pronounced artifacts. Our Spectral-GS, based on spectral analysis, introduces 3D shape-aware splitting and 2D view-consistent filtering strategies, effectively addressing these issues, enhancing 3D-GS's capability to represent high-frequency details without noticeable artifacts, and achieving high-quality photorealistic rendering.",

    "abstract": "We propose DrivingForward, a feed-forward Gaussian Splatting model that reconstructs driving scenes from flexible surround-view input. Driving scene images from vehicle-mounted cameras are typically sparse, with limited overlap, and the movement of the vehicle further complicates the acquisition of camera extrinsics. To tackle these challenges and achieve real-time reconstruction, we jointly train a pose network, a depth network, and a Gaussian network to predict the Gaussian primitives that represent the driving scenes. The pose network and depth network determine the position of the Gaussian primitives in a self-supervised manner, without using depth ground truth and camera extrinsics during training. The Gaussian network independently predicts primitive parameters from each input image, including covariance, opacity, and spherical harmonics coefficients. At the inference stage, our model can achieve feed-forward reconstruction from flexible multi-frame surround-view input. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art feed-forward and scene-optimized reconstruction methods in terms of reconstruction.",

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Furthermore, we enhance the whole SLAM system, resulting in improved tracking and mapping performance. Our Hi-SLAM outperforms existing dense SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy, while achieving a 2x operation speed-up. Additionally, it exhibits competitive performance in rendering semantic segmentation in small synthetic scenes, with significantly reduced storage and training time requirements. Rendering FPS impressively reaches 2,000 with semantic information and 3,000 without it. Most notably, it showcases the capability of handling the complex real-world scene with more than 500 semantic classes, highlighting its valuable scaling-up capability.",

    "abstract": "Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D geometry. While stereo depth estimation can be achieved through triangulation methods, it is not as straightforward for monocular methods, which require the integration of global and local information. The Depth from Defocus (DFD) method utilizes camera lens models and parameters to recover depth information from blurred images and has been proven to perform well. However, these methods rely on All-In-Focus (AIF) images for depth estimation, which is nearly impossible to obtain in real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised framework based on 3D Gaussian splatting and Siamese networks. By learning the blur levels at different focal distances of the same scene in the focal stack, the framework predicts the defocus map and Circle of Confusion (CoC) from a single defocused image, using the defocus map as input to DepthNet for monocular depth estimation. The 3D Gaussian splatting model renders defocused images using the predicted CoC, and the differences between these and the real defocused images provide additional supervision signals for the Siamese Defocus self-supervised network. This framework has been validated on both artificially synthesized and real blurred datasets. Subsequent quantitative and visualization experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework is highly effective as a DFD method.",

In the fine phase, we extract a Signed Distance Function (SDF) directly from learned Gaussian Splatting, optimizing it with a differentiable isosurface representation. Furthermore, it elevates the quality of generation by using a disentangled representation with two independent implicit functions to capture both visible and obscured aspects of objects. Additionally, it harmonizes gradients from 2D diffusion prior with 3D-aware diffusion priors by angular diffusion prior composition.

Recent approaches address this challenge with computationally efficient geometry primitives in a carefully calibrated multi-view setup. Albeit producing photorealistic head renderings, it often fails to represent complex motion changes such as the mouth interior and strongly varying head poses. We propose a new method to generate highly dynamic and deformable human head avatars from multi-view imagery in real-time. At the core of our method is a hierarchical representation of head models that allows to capture the complex dynamics of facial expressions and head movements. First, with rich facial features extracted from raw input frames, we learn to deform the coarse facial geometry of the template mesh. We then initialize 3D Gaussians on the deformed surface and refine their positions in a fine step. We train this coarse-to-fine facial avatar model along with the head pose as a learnable parameter in an end-to-end framework. This enables not only controllable facial animation via video inputs, but also high-fidelity novel view synthesis of challenging facial expressions, such as tongue deformations and fine-grained teeth structure under large motion changes. Moreover, it encourages the learned head avatar to generalize towards new facial expressions and head poses at inference time. We demonstrate the performance of our method with comparisons against the related methods on different datasets, spanning challenging facial expression sequences across multiple identities. We also show the potential application of our approach by demonstrating a cross-identity facial performance transfer application.",

More concretely, given a pair of extrinsically aligned shapes, we first render them from multi-views, and then utilize an image interpolation framework based on diffusion models to generate sequences of intermediate images between them. The images are later fed into a dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting framework, with which we reconstruct and post-process for intermediate point clouds respecting the image morphing processing. In the end, tailored for the above, we propose a novel registration module to estimate continuous normalizing flow, which deforms source shape consistently towards the target, with intermediate point clouds as weak guidance. Our key insight is to leverage large vision models (LVMs) to associate shapes and therefore obtain much richer semantic information on the relationship between shapes than the ad-hoc feature extraction and alignment. As a consequence, SRIF achieves high-quality dense correspondences on challenging shape pairs, but also delivers smooth, semantically meaningful interpolation in between. Empirical evidence justifies the effectiveness and superiority of our method as well as specific design choices. The code is released at https://github.com/rqhuang88/SRIF.",

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a practical and scalable reconstruction method, gaining popularity due to its impressive reconstruction quality, real-time rendering capabilities, and compatibility with widely used visualization tools. However, the method requires a substantial number of input views to achieve high-quality scene reconstruction, introducing a significant practical bottleneck. This challenge is especially severe in capturing dynamic scenes, where deploying an extensive camera array can be prohibitively costly. In this work, we identify the lack of spatial autocorrelation of splat features as one of the factors contributing to the suboptimal performance of the 3DGS technique in sparse reconstruction settings. To address the issue, we propose an optimization strategy that effectively regularizes splat features by modeling them as the outputs of a corresponding implicit neural field. This results in a consistent enhancement of reconstruction quality across various scenarios. Our approach effectively handles static and dynamic cases, as demonstrated by extensive testing across different setups and scene complexities.",

Our method mitigates the dependence on complex neural network models while demonstrating improved robustness against noise and higher localization accuracy in challenging environments, as compared to neural network joint optimization strategies. The optimization framework proposed in this paper introduces novel approaches to visual localization by integrating the advantages of 3D reconstruction and heuristic refinement strategy, which demonstrates strong performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including 7Scenes and DB dataset.",

    "abstract": "We propose two novel ideas (adoption of deferred rendering and mesh-based representation) to improve the quality of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) based inverse rendering. We first report a problem incurred by hidden Gaussians, where Gaussians beneath the surface adversely affect the pixel color in the volume rendering adopted by the existing methods. In order to resolve the problem, we propose applying deferred rendering and report new problems incurred in a naive application of deferred rendering to the existing 3DGS-based inverse rendering. In an effort to improve the quality of 3DGS-based inverse rendering under deferred rendering, we propose a novel two-step training approach which (1) exploits mesh extraction and utilizes a hybrid mesh-3DGS representation and (2) applies novel regularization methods to better exploit the mesh. Our experiments show that, under relighting, the proposed method offers significantly better rendering quality than the existing 3DGS-based inverse rendering methods. Compared with the SOTA voxel grid-based inverse rendering method, it gives better rendering quality while offering real-time rendering.",

    "abstract": "Kernel image regression methods have shown to provide excellent efficiency in many image processing task, such as image and light-field compression, Gaussian Splatting, denoising and super-resolution. The estimation of parameters for these methods frequently employ gradient descent iterative optimization, which poses significant computational burden for many applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptive segmentation-based initialization method targeted for optimizing Steered-Mixture-of Experts (SMoE) gating networks and Radial-Basis-Function (RBF) networks with steering kernels. The novel initialization method allocates kernels into pre-calculated image segments. The optimal number of kernels, kernel positions, and steering parameters are derived per segment in an iterative optimization and kernel sparsification procedure. The kernel information from \"local\" segments is then transferred into a \"global\" initialization, ready for use in iterative optimization of SMoE, RBF, and related kernel image regression methods. Results show that drastic objective and subjective quality improvements are achievable compared to widely used regular grid initialization, \"state-of-the-art\" K-Means initialization and previously introduced segmentation-based initialization methods, while also drastically improving the sparsity of the regression models. For same quality, the novel initialization results in models with around 50% reduction of kernels. In addition, a significant reduction of convergence time is achieved, with overall run-time savings of up to 50%. The segmentation-based initialization strategy itself admits heavy parallel computation; in theory, it may be divided into as many tasks as there are segments in the images. By accessing only four parallel GPUs, run-time savings of already 50% for initialization are achievable.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents DENSER, an efficient and effective approach leveraging 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) for the reconstruction of dynamic urban environments. While several methods for photorealistic scene representations, both implicitly using neural radiance fields (NeRF) and explicitly using 3DGS have shown promising results in scene reconstruction of relatively complex dynamic scenes, modeling the dynamic appearance of foreground objects tend to be challenging, limiting the applicability of these methods to capture subtleties and details of the scenes, especially far dynamic objects. To this end, we propose DENSER, a framework that significantly enhances the representation of dynamic objects and accurately models the appearance of dynamic objects in the driving scene. Instead of directly using Spherical Harmonics (SH) to model the appearance of dynamic objects, we introduce and integrate a new method aiming at dynamically estimating SH bases using wavelets, resulting in better representation of dynamic objects appearance in both space and time. Besides object appearance, DENSER enhances object shape representation through densification of its point cloud across multiple scene frames, resulting in faster convergence of model training. Extensive evaluations on KITTI dataset show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin.

Of the total compute time, a small fraction of it consumes GPU resources, enabling uninterrupted training. The safety layer is minimally invasive, correcting robot actions only when they are unsafe. To showcase the safety filter, we also introduce SplatBridge, an open-source software package built with ROS for real-time GSplat mapping for robots. We demonstrate the safety and robustness of our pipeline first in simulation, where our method is 20-50x faster, safer, and less conservative than competing methods based on neural radiance fields. Further, we demonstrate simultaneous GSplat mapping and safety filtering on a drone hardware platform using only on-board perception.

Nevertheless, the huge file size of the 3D Gaussians presents challenges for transmission and storage. Current works design compact models to replace the substantial volume and attributes of 3D Gaussians, along with intensive training to distill information. These endeavors demand considerable training time, presenting formidable hurdles for practical deployment. To this end, we propose MesonGS, a codec for post-training compression of 3D Gaussians. Initially, we introduce a measurement criterion that considers both view-dependent and view-independent factors to assess the impact of each Gaussian point on the rendering output, enabling the removal of insignificant points. Subsequently, we decrease the entropy of attributes through two transformations that complement subsequent entropy coding techniques to enhance the file compression rate. More specifically, we first replace rotation quaternions with Euler angles; then, we apply region adaptive hierarchical transform to key attributes to reduce entropy. Lastly, we adopt finer-grained quantization to avoid excessive information loss. Moreover, a well-crafted finetune scheme is devised to restore quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MesonGS significantly reduces the size of 3D Gaussians while preserving competitive quality.",

On these devices, memory is often limited in capacity and its access often dominates the consumption of compute energy. Although Gaussian Splatting (GS) allows for high-fidelity reconstruction of 3D scenes, current GS-based SLAM is not memory efficient as a large number of past images is stored to retrain Gaussians for reducing catastrophic forgetting. These images often require two-orders-of-magnitude higher memory than the map itself and thus dominate the total memory usage. In this work, we present GEVO, a GS-based monocular SLAM framework that achieves comparable fidelity as prior methods by rendering (instead of storing) them from the existing map. Novel Gaussian initialization and optimization techniques are proposed to remove artifacts from the map and delay the degradation of the rendered images over time. Across a variety of environments, GEVO achieves comparable map fidelity while reducing the memory overhead to around 58 MBs, which is up to 94x lower than prior works.",

We introduce a method to create relightable radiance fields using such single-illumination data by exploiting priors extracted from 2D image diffusion models. We first fine-tune a 2D diffusion model on a multi-illumination dataset conditioned by light direction, allowing us to augment a single-illumination capture into a realistic -- but possibly inconsistent -- multi-illumination dataset from directly defined light directions. We use this augmented data to create a relightable radiance field represented by 3D Gaussian splats. To allow direct control of light direction for low-frequency lighting, we represent appearance with a multi-layer perceptron parameterized on light direction. To enforce multi-view consistency and overcome inaccuracies we optimize a per-image auxiliary feature vector. We show results on synthetic and real multi-view data under single illumination, demonstrating that our method successfully exploits 2D diffusion model priors to allow realistic 3D relighting for complete scenes.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a recent explicit 3D representation that has achieved high-quality reconstruction and real-time rendering of complex scenes. However, the rasterization pipeline still suffers from unnecessary overhead resulting from avoidable serial Gaussian culling, and uneven load due to the distinct number of Gaussian to be rendered across pixels, which hinders wider promotion and application of 3DGS. In order to accelerate Gaussian splatting, we propose AdR-Gaussian, which moves part of serial culling in Render stage into the earlier Preprocess stage to enable parallel culling, employing adaptive radius to narrow the rendering pixel range for each Gaussian, and introduces a load balancing method to minimize thread waiting time during the pixel-parallel rendering. Our contributions are threefold, achieving a rendering speed of 310% while maintaining equivalent or even better quality than the state-of-the-art. Firstly, we propose to early cull Gaussian-Tile pairs of low splatting opacity based on an adaptive radius in the Gaussian-parallel Preprocess stage, which reduces the number of affected tile through the Gaussian bounding circle, thus reducing unnecessary overhead and achieving faster rendering speed. Secondly, we further propose early culling based on axis-aligned bounding box for Gaussian splatting, which achieves a more significant reduction in ineffective expenses by accurately calculating the Gaussian size in the 2D directions. Thirdly, we propose a balancing algorithm for pixel thread load, which compresses the information of heavy-load pixels to reduce thread waiting time, and enhance information of light-load pixels to hedge against rendering quality loss. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly improve the Gaussian Splatting rendering speed.",

However, the need for extensive manual intervention to stabilize mesh sequences and the generation of excessively large assets in existing workflows impedes broader adoption. In this paper, we present a novel Gaussian-based approach, dubbed \\textit{DualGS}, for real-time and high-fidelity playback of complex human performance with excellent compression ratios. Our key idea in DualGS is to separately represent motion and appearance using the corresponding skin and joint Gaussians. Such an explicit disentanglement can significantly reduce motion redundancy and enhance temporal coherence. We begin by initializing the DualGS and anchoring skin Gaussians to joint Gaussians at the first frame. Subsequently, we employ a coarse-to-fine training strategy for frame-by-frame human performance modeling. It includes a coarse alignment phase for overall motion prediction as well as a fine-grained optimization for robust tracking and high-fidelity rendering. To integrate volumetric video seamlessly into VR environments, we efficiently compress motion using entropy encoding and appearance using codec compression coupled with a persistent codebook. Our approach achieves a compression ratio of up to 120 times, only requiring approximately 350KB of storage per frame.

    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of accurately segmenting 3D Gaussian Splatting from 2D masks. Conventional methods often rely on iterative gradient descent to assign each Gaussian a unique label, leading to lengthy optimization and sub-optimal solutions. Instead, we propose a straightforward yet globally optimal solver for 3D-GS segmentation. The core insight of our method is that, with a reconstructed 3D-GS scene, the rendering of the 2D masks is essentially a linear function with respect to the labels of each Gaussian. As such, the optimal label assignment can be solved via linear programming in closed form. This solution capitalizes on the alpha blending characteristic of the splatting process for single step optimization. By incorporating the background bias in our objective function, our method shows superior robustness in 3D segmentation against noises. Remarkably, our optimization completes within 30 seconds, about 50$\\times$ faster than the best existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method in segmenting various scenes, and its superior performance in downstream tasks such as object removal and inpainting. Demos and code will be available at https://github.com/florinshen/FlashSplat.",

    "abstract": "Novel-view synthesis based on visible light has been extensively studied. In comparison to visible light imaging, thermal infrared imaging offers the advantage of all-weather imaging and strong penetration, providing increased possibilities for reconstruction in nighttime and adverse weather scenarios. However, thermal infrared imaging is influenced by physical characteristics such as atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction, hindering the precise reconstruction of intricate details in thermal infrared scenes, manifesting as issues of floaters and indistinct edge features in synthesized images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a physics-induced 3D Gaussian splatting method named Thermal3D-GS. Thermal3D-GS begins by modeling atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction in three-dimensional media using neural networks. Additionally, a temperature consistency constraint is incorporated into the optimization objective to enhance the reconstruction accuracy of thermal infrared images. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of our method, the first large-scale benchmark dataset for this field named Thermal Infrared Novel-view Synthesis Dataset (TI-NSD) is created. This dataset comprises 20 authentic thermal infrared video scenes, covering indoor, outdoor, and UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) scenarios, totaling 6,664 frames of thermal infrared image data. Based on this dataset, this paper experimentally verifies the effectiveness of Thermal3D-GS. The results indicate that our method outperforms the baseline method with a 3.03 dB improvement in PSNR and significantly addresses the issues of floaters and indistinct edge features present in the baseline method. Our dataset and codebase will be released in \\href{https://github.com/mzzcdf/Thermal3DGS}{\\textcolor{red}{Thermal3DGS}}.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have garnered significant attention in computer vision and computer graphics due to its high rendering speed and remarkable quality. While extant research has endeavored to extend the application of 3DGS from static to dynamic scenes, such efforts have been consistently impeded by excessive model sizes, constraints on video duration, and content deviation. These limitations significantly compromise the streamability of dynamic 3D Gaussian models, thereby restricting their utility in downstream applications, including volumetric video, autonomous vehicle, and immersive technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality.   This paper introduces SwinGS, a novel framework for training, delivering, and rendering volumetric video in a real-time streaming fashion. To address the aforementioned challenges and enhance streamability, SwinGS integrates spacetime Gaussian with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to adapt the model to fit various 3D scenes across frames, in the meantime employing a sliding window captures Gaussian snapshots for each frame in an accumulative way. We implement a prototype of SwinGS and demonstrate its streamability across various datasets and scenes. Additionally, we develop an interactive WebGL viewer enabling real-time volumetric video playback on most devices with modern browsers, including smartphones and tablets. Experimental results show that SwinGS reduces transmission costs by 83.6% compared to previous work with ignorable compromise in PSNR. Moreover, SwinGS easily scales to long video sequences without compromising quality.",

    "abstract": "Despite having tremendous progress in image-to-3D generation, existing methods still struggle to produce multi-view consistent images with high-resolution textures in detail, especially in the paradigm of 2D diffusion that lacks 3D awareness. In this work, we present High-resolution Image-to-3D model (Hi3D), a new video diffusion based paradigm that redefines a single image to multi-view images as 3D-aware sequential image generation (i.e., orbital video generation). This methodology delves into the underlying temporal consistency knowledge in video diffusion model that generalizes well to geometry consistency across multiple views in 3D generation. Technically, Hi3D first empowers the pre-trained video diffusion model with 3D-aware prior (camera pose condition), yielding multi-view images with low-resolution texture details. A 3D-aware video-to-video refiner is learnt to further scale up the multi-view images with high-resolution texture details. Such high-resolution multi-view images are further augmented with novel views through 3D Gaussian Splatting, which are finally leveraged to obtain high-fidelity meshes via 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both novel view synthesis and single view reconstruction demonstrate that our Hi3D manages to produce superior multi-view consistency images with highly-detailed textures.

We conduct extensive evaluations and user studies, compared to traditional offline and online renderers, as well as recent neural rendering methods, which demonstrate the superior performance of our approach for facial asset rendering.

By using a shared feature extractor before decoding Gaussian colors, covariances, positions, and opacities, GSNs achieve extremely high throughput (>150FPS). Experiments demonstrate that GSNs can be trained efficiently using a multi-view rendering loss and are competitive, in quality, with expensive diffusion-based reconstruction algorithms.

Some recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are proposed to reconstruct the thermal scenes in 3D from a set of thermal and RGB images. However, unlike NeRF, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) prevails due to its rapid training and real-time rendering. In this work, we propose ThermalGaussian, the first thermal 3DGS approach capable of rendering high-quality images in RGB and thermal modalities. We first calibrate the RGB camera and the thermal camera to ensure that both modalities are accurately aligned. Subsequently, we use the registered images to learn the multimodal 3D Gaussians. To prevent the overfitting of any single modality, we introduce several multimodal regularization constraints. We also develop smoothing constraints tailored to the physical characteristics of the thermal modality. Besides, we contribute a real-world dataset named RGBT-Scenes, captured by a hand-hold thermal-infrared camera, facilitating future research on thermal scene reconstruction. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that ThermalGaussian achieves photorealistic rendering of thermal images and improves the rendering quality of RGB images. With the proposed multimodal regularization constraints, we also reduced the model's storage cost by 90\\%. The code and dataset will be released.",

This task is particularly difficult due to the high GPU memory consumption, different levels of details for geometric representation, and noticeable inconsistencies in appearance. To this end, we propose GigaGS, the first work for high-quality surface reconstruction for large-scale scenes using 3DGS. GigaGS first applies a partitioning strategy based on the mutual visibility of spatial regions, which effectively grouping cameras for parallel processing. To enhance the quality of the surface, we also propose novel multi-view photometric and geometric consistency constraints based on Level-of-Detail representation. In doing so, our method can reconstruct detailed surface structures. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on various datasets. The consistent improvement demonstrates the superiority of GigaGS.",

    "abstract": "Physics simulation is paramount for modeling and utilization of 3D scenes in various real-world applications. However, its integration with state-of-the-art 3D scene rendering techniques such as Gaussian Splatting (GS) remains challenging. Existing models use additional meshing mechanisms, including triangle or tetrahedron meshing, marching cubes, or cage meshes. As an alternative, we can modify the physics grounded Newtonian dynamics to align with 3D Gaussian components. Current models take the first-order approximation of a deformation map, which locally approximates the dynamics by linear transformations. In contrast, our Gaussian Splatting for Physics-Based Simulations (GASP) model uses such a map (without any modifications) and flat Gaussian distributions, which are parameterized by three points (mesh faces). Subsequently, each 3D point (mesh face node) is treated as a discrete entity within a 3D space. Consequently, the problem of modeling Gaussian components is reduced to working with 3D points. Additionally, the information on mesh faces can be used to incorporate further properties into the physics model, facilitating the use of triangles. Resulting solution can be integrated into any physics engine that can be treated as a black box. As demonstrated in our studies, the proposed model exhibits superior performance on a diverse range of benchmark datasets designed for 3D object rendering.",

We present LiDAR-3DGS, a novel method of reinforcing 3DGS inputs with LiDAR generated point clouds to significantly improve the accuracy and detail of 3D models. We demonstrate a systematic approach of LiDAR reinforcement to 3DGS to enable capturing of important features such as bolts, apertures, and other details that are often missed by image-based features alone. These details are crucial for engineering applications such as remote monitoring and maintenance. Without modifying the underlying 3DGS algorithm, we demonstrate that even a modest addition of LiDAR generated point cloud significantly enhances the perceptual quality of the models. At 30k iterations, the model generated by our method resulted in an increase of 7.064% in PSNR and 0.565% in SSIM, respectively. Since the LiDAR used in this research was a commonly used commercial-grade device, the improvements observed were modest and can be further enhanced with higher-grade LiDAR systems. Additionally, these improvements can be supplementary to other derivative works of Radiance Field Rendering and also provide a new insight for future LiDAR and computer vision integrated modeling.",

We achieve this by incorporating a point-based representation into the high-resolution layers of the hierarchical hash tables of an InstantNGP representation. As our points are equipped with a field of influence, our representation can be interpreted as a mixture of Gaussians stored within the hash table. We propose a loss that encourages the movement of our Gaussians towards regions that require more representation budget to be sufficiently well represented. Our main finding is that our representation allows the reconstruction of signals using a more compact representation without compromising quality.",

In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of SDS and refine its formulation, finding that the core design is to model the distribution of rendered images. Following this insight, we introduce a novel strategy called Variational Distribution Mapping (VDM), which expedites the distribution modeling process by regarding the rendered images as instances of degradation from diffusion-based generation. This special design enables the efficient training of variational distribution by skipping the calculations of the Jacobians in the diffusion U-Net. We also introduce timestep-dependent Distribution Coefficient Annealing (DCA) to further improve distilling precision. Leveraging VDM and DCA, we use Gaussian Splatting as the 3D representation and build a text-to-3D generation framework. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate the capability of VDM and DCA to generate high-fidelity and realistic assets with optimization efficiency.",

Our pipeline utilizes transformers as the backbone for self-supervised pre-training and introduces novel contrastive learning tasks through 3DGS.

Additionally, we incorporate features from depth maps. By optimizing these tasks collectively, our method enriches the tri-modal self-supervised learning process, enabling the model to leverage the correlation across 3D point clouds and 2D images from various modalities. We freeze the encoder after pre-training and test the model's performance on multiple downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing realistic 3D human models from monocular images has significant applications in creative industries, human-computer interfaces, and healthcare. We base our work on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a scene representation composed of a mixture of Gaussians. Predicting such mixtures for a human from a single input image is challenging, as it is a non-uniform density (with a many-to-one relationship with input pixels) with strict physical constraints. At the same time, it needs to be flexible to accommodate a variety of clothes and poses. Our key observation is that the vertices of standardized human meshes (such as SMPL) can provide an adequate density and approximate initial position for Gaussians. We can then train a transformer model to jointly predict comparatively small adjustments to these positions, as well as the other Gaussians' attributes and the SMPL parameters. We show empirically that this combination (using only multi-view supervision) can achieve fast inference of 3D human models from a single image without test-time optimization, expensive diffusion models, or 3D points supervision. We also show that it can improve 3D pose estimation by better fitting human models that account for clothes and other variations.

To address this, we propose a novel approach: learning-based multi-view image coding with 3D Gaussian geometric priors (3D-GP-LMVIC). Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to derive geometric priors of the 3D scene, enabling more accurate disparity estimation across views within the compression model. Additionally, we introduce a depth map compression model to reduce redundancy in geometric information between views. A multi-view sequence ordering method is also proposed to enhance correlations between adjacent views.

While recent advancements such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable successes in 3D reconstruction, these methods typically necessitate hundreds of input images that densely capture the underlying scene, making them time-consuming and impractical for real-world applications. However, sparse-view reconstruction is inherently ill-posed and under-constrained, often resulting in inferior and incomplete outcomes. This is due to issues such as failed initialization, overfitting on input images, and a lack of details. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce LM-Gaussian, a method capable of generating high-quality reconstructions from a limited number of images. Specifically, we propose a robust initialization module that leverages stereo priors to aid in the recovery of camera poses and the reliable point clouds. Additionally, a diffusion-based refinement is iteratively applied to incorporate image diffusion priors into the Gaussian optimization process to preserve intricate scene details. Finally, we utilize video diffusion priors to further enhance the rendered images for realistic visual effects. Overall, our approach significantly reduces the data acquisition requirements compared to previous 3DGS methods. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on various public datasets, demonstrating its potential for high-quality 360-degree scene reconstruction.

To address this, we propose Human-VDM, a novel method for generating 3D human from a single RGB image using Video Diffusion Models. Human-VDM provides temporally consistent views for 3D human generation using Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three modules: a view-consistent human video diffusion module, a video augmentation module, and a Gaussian Splatting module. First, a single image is fed into a human video diffusion module to generate a coherent human video. Next, the video augmentation module applies super-resolution and video interpolation to enhance the textures and geometric smoothness of the generated video. Finally, the 3D Human Gaussian Splatting module learns lifelike humans under the guidance of these high-resolution and view-consistent images. Experiments demonstrate that Human-VDM achieves high-quality 3D human from a single image, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both generation quality and quantity.

Yet its performance still suffers and tends to overfit with fewer input views. Embracing this challenge, we introduce SGPose, a novel framework for sparse view object pose estimation using Gaussian-based methods. Given as few as ten views, SGPose generates a geometric-aware representation by starting with a random cuboid initialization, eschewing reliance on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline-derived geometry as required by traditional 3DGS methods. SGPose removes the dependence on CAD models by regressing dense 2D-3D correspondences between images and the reconstructed model from sparse input and random initialization, while the geometric-consistent depth supervision and online synthetic view warping are key to the success. Experiments on typical benchmarks, especially on the Occlusion LM-O dataset, demonstrate that SGPose outperforms existing methods even under sparse view constraints, under-scoring its potential in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing scenes and tracking motion are two sides of the same coin. Tracking points allow for geometric reconstruction [14], while geometric reconstruction of (dynamic) scenes allows for 3D tracking of points over time [24, 39]. The latter was recently also exploited for 2D point tracking to overcome occlusion ambiguities by lifting tracking directly into 3D [38]. However, above approaches either require offline processing or multi-view camera setups both unrealistic for real-world applications like robot navigation or mixed reality. We target the challenge of online 2D and 3D point tracking from unposed monocular camera input introducing Dynamic Online Monocular Reconstruction (DynOMo). We leverage 3D Gaussian splatting to reconstruct dynamic scenes in an online fashion. Our approach extends 3D Gaussians to capture new content and object motions while estimating camera movements from a single RGB frame. DynOMo stands out by enabling emergence of point trajectories through robust image feature reconstruction and a novel similarity-enhanced regularization term, without requiring any correspondence-level supervision. It sets the first baseline for online point tracking with monocular unposed cameras, achieving performance on par with existing methods. We aim to inspire the community to advance online point tracking and reconstruction, expanding the applicability to diverse real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Over the past year, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has received significant attention for its ability to represent 3D scenes in a perceptually accurate manner. However, it can require a substantial amount of storage since each splat's individual data must be stored. While compression techniques offer a potential solution by reducing the memory footprint, they still necessitate retrieving the entire scene before any part of it can be rendered. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for progressively rendering such scenes, aiming to display visible content that closely approximates the final scene as early as possible without loading the entire scene into memory. This approach benefits both on-device rendering applications limited by memory constraints and streaming applications where minimal bandwidth usage is preferred. To achieve this, we approximate the contribution of each Gaussian to the final scene and construct an order of prioritization on their inclusion in the rendering process. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be combined with existing compression methods to progressively render (and stream) 3DGS scenes, optimizing bandwidth usage by focusing on the most important splats within a scene. Overall, our work establishes a foundation for making remotely hosted 3DGS content more quickly accessible to end-users in over-the-top consumption scenarios, with our results showing significant improvements in quality across all metrics compared to existing methods.",

However, existing learning-based point cloud upsampling methods are constrained by computational resources and batch processing strategies, which often require subdividing point clouds into smaller patches, leading to distortions that degrade perceptual quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel 2D-3D hybrid colored point cloud upsampling framework (GaussianPU) based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for robotic perception. This approach leverages 3DGS to bridge 3D point clouds with their 2D rendered images in robot vision systems. A dual scale rendered image restoration network transforms sparse point cloud renderings into dense representations, which are then input into 3DGS along with precise robot camera poses and interpolated sparse point clouds to reconstruct dense 3D point clouds. We have made a series of enhancements to the vanilla 3DGS, enabling precise control over the number of points and significantly boosting the quality of the upsampled point cloud for robotic scene understanding. Our framework supports processing entire point clouds on a single consumer-grade GPU, such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, eliminating the need for segmentation and thus producing high-quality, dense colored point clouds with millions of points for robot navigation and manipulation tasks. Extensive experimental results on generating million-level point cloud data validate the effectiveness of our method, substantially improving the quality of colored point clouds and demonstrating significant potential for applications involving large-scale point clouds in autonomous robotics and human-robot interaction scenarios.",

Despite the importance, existing 3D reconstruction methods encounter several challenges, including stringent demands for accuracy, imprecise camera positioning, intricate dynamic scenes, and the necessity for rapid reconstruction. Addressing these issues, this paper presents the first camera-pose-free scene reconstruction framework, Free-DyGS, tailored for dynamic surgical videos, leveraging 3D Gaussian splatting technology. Our approach employs a frame-by-frame reconstruction strategy and is delineated into four distinct phases: Scene Initialization, Joint Learning, Scene Expansion, and Retrospective Learning. We introduce a Generalizable Gaussians Parameterization module within the Scene Initialization and Expansion phases to proficiently generate Gaussian attributes for each pixel from the RGBD frames. The Joint Learning phase is crafted to concurrently deduce scene deformation and camera pose, facilitated by an innovative flexible deformation module. In the scene expansion stage, the Gaussian points gradually grow as the camera moves. The Retrospective Learning phase is dedicated to enhancing the precision of scene deformation through the reassessment of prior frames. The efficacy of the proposed Free-DyGS is substantiated through experiments on two datasets: the StereoMIS and Hamlyn datasets. The experimental outcomes underscore that Free-DyGS surpasses conventional baseline models in both rendering fidelity and computational efficiency.",

Nevertheless, existing methods excessively rely on per-pixel depth cues to perform map densification, which leads to significant redundancy and increased sensitivity to depth noise. Additionally, explicitly storing 3D Gaussian parameters of room-scale scene poses a significant storage challenge. In this paper, we introduce OG-Mapping, which leverages the robust scene structural representation capability of sparse octrees, combined with structured 3D Gaussian representations, to achieve efficient and robust online dense mapping. Moreover, OG-Mapping employs an anchor-based progressive map refinement strategy to recover the scene structures at multiple levels of detail. Instead of maintaining a small number of active keyframes with a fixed keyframe window as previous approaches do, a dynamic keyframe window is employed to allow OG-Mapping to better tackle false local minima and forgetting issues. Experimental results demonstrate that OG-Mapping delivers more robust and superior realism mapping results than existing Gaussian-based RGB-D online mapping methods with a compact model, and no additional post-processing is required.",

To enhance the representation power, we draw inspiration from quantum physics and propose to use the Gaussian-Hermite kernel as the new primitive in Gaussian splatting. The new kernel takes a unified mathematical form and extends the Gaussian function, which serves as the zero-rank term in the updated formulation.

Despite great success in dense-view reconstruction scenarios, rendering a detailed scene from insufficient captured views is still an ill-posed optimization problem, often resulting in artifacts and distortions in unseen areas. In this paper, we propose ReconX, a novel 3D scene reconstruction paradigm that reframes the ambiguous reconstruction challenge as a temporal generation task. The key insight is to unleash the strong generative prior of large pre-trained video diffusion models for sparse-view reconstruction. However, 3D view consistency struggles to be accurately preserved in directly generated video frames from pre-trained models. To address this, given limited input views, the proposed ReconX first constructs a global point cloud and encodes it into a contextual space as the 3D structure condition. Guided by the condition, the video diffusion model then synthesizes video frames that are both detail-preserved and exhibit a high degree of 3D consistency, ensuring the coherence of the scene from various perspectives. Finally, we recover the 3D scene from the generated video through a confidence-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets show the superiority of our ReconX over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and generalizability.",

To that end, we propose a comprehensive 3DGS framework for driving scenes, named OmniRe, that allows for accurate, full-length reconstruction of diverse dynamic objects in a driving log. OmniRe builds dynamic neural scene graphs based on Gaussian representations and constructs multiple local canonical spaces that model various dynamic actors, including vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists, among many others. This capability is unmatched by existing methods. OmniRe allows us to holistically reconstruct different objects present in the scene, subsequently enabling the simulation of reconstructed scenarios with all actors participating in real-time (~60Hz). Extensive evaluations on the Waymo dataset show that our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively by a large margin.

COLMAP is frequently employed for preprocessing to estimate poses, while it necessitates a large number of feature matches to operate effectively, and it struggles with scenes characterized by sparse features, large baselines between images, or a limited number of input images. We aim to tackle few-view NeRF reconstruction using only 3 to 6 unposed scene images. Traditional methods often use calibration boards but they are not common in images. We propose a novel idea of utilizing everyday objects, commonly found in both images and real life, as \"pose probes\". The probe object is automatically segmented by SAM, whose shape is initialized from a cube. We apply a dual-branch volume rendering optimization (object NeRF and scene NeRF) to constrain the pose optimization and jointly refine the geometry. Specifically, object poses of two views are first estimated by PnP matching in an SDF representation, which serves as initial poses. PnP matching, requiring only a few features, is suitable for feature-sparse scenes. Additional views are incrementally incorporated to refine poses from preceding views. In experiments, PoseProbe achieves state-of-the-art performance in both pose estimation and novel view synthesis across multiple datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness, particularly in few-view and large-baseline scenes where COLMAP struggles. In ablations, using different objects in a scene yields comparable performance.

Previous works mostly focus on shape composition, making them very hard to use for realistic composition of 3D objects captured from real-world scenes. This leads to combining multiple NeRFs into a single 3D scene to achieve seamless appearance blending. However, the current SeamlessNeRF method struggles to achieve interactive editing and harmonious stitching for real-world scenes due to its gradient-based strategy and grid-based representation. To this end, we present an example-based modeling method that combines multiple Gaussian fields in a point-based representation using sample-guided synthesis. Specifically, as for composition, we create a GUI to segment and transform multiple fields in real time, easily obtaining a semantically meaningful composition of models represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). For texture blending, due to the discrete and irregular nature of 3DGS, straightforwardly applying gradient propagation as SeamlssNeRF is not supported. Thus, a novel sampling-based cloning method is proposed to harmonize the blending while preserving the original rich texture and content. Our workflow consists of three steps: 1) real-time segmentation and transformation of a Gaussian model using a well-tailored GUI, 2) KNN analysis to identify boundary points in the intersecting area between the source and target models, and 3) two-phase optimization of the target model using sampling-based cloning and gradient constraints. Extensive experimental results validate that our approach significantly outperforms previous works in terms of realistic synthesis, demonstrating its practicality.

Gaussian Splatting is a powerful 3D representation for novel view synthesis, as -- compared to other approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields -- it provides fast scene renderings and user control over the scene. Recent pre-prints have demonstrated that the style of Gaussian Splatting scenes can be modified using an image exemplar. However, since the scene geometry remains fixed during the stylization process, current solutions fall short of producing satisfactory results. Our algorithm aims to address these limitations by following a three-step process: In a pre-processing step, we remove undesirable Gaussians with large projection areas or highly elongated shapes. Subsequently, we combine several losses carefully designed to preserve different scales of the style in the image, while maintaining as much as possible the integrity of the original scene content. During the stylization process and following the original design of Gaussian Splatting, we split Gaussians where additional detail is necessary within our scene by tracking the gradient of the stylized color. Our experiments demonstrate that G-Style generates high-quality stylizations within just a few minutes, outperforming existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

    "abstract": "Robust and realistic rendering for large-scale road scenes is essential in autonomous driving simulation. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has made groundbreaking progress in neural rendering, but the general fidelity of large-scale road scene renderings is often limited by the input imagery, which usually has a narrow field of view and focuses mainly on the street-level local area. Intuitively, the data from the drone's perspective can provide a complementary viewpoint for the data from the ground vehicle's perspective, enhancing the completeness of scene reconstruction and rendering. However, training naively with aerial and ground images, which exhibit large view disparity, poses a significant convergence challenge for 3D-GS, and does not demonstrate remarkable improvements in performance on road views. In order to enhance the novel view synthesis of road views and to effectively use the aerial information, we design an uncertainty-aware training method that allows aerial images to assist in the synthesis of areas where ground images have poor learning outcomes instead of weighting all pixels equally in 3D-GS training like prior work did. We are the first to introduce the cross-view uncertainty to 3D-GS by matching the car-view ensemble-based rendering uncertainty to aerial images, weighting the contribution of each pixel to the training process. Additionally, to systematically quantify evaluation metrics, we assemble a high-quality synthesized dataset comprising both aerial and ground images for road scenes.",

    "abstract": "3D reconstruction aims to recover the dense 3D structure of a scene. It plays an essential role in various applications such as Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), autonomous driving and robotics. Leveraging multiple views of a scene captured from different viewpoints, Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms synthesize a comprehensive 3D representation, enabling precise reconstruction in complex environments. Due to its efficiency and effectiveness, MVS has become a pivotal method for image-based 3D reconstruction. Recently, with the success of deep learning, many learning-based MVS methods have been proposed, achieving impressive performance against traditional methods. We categorize these learning-based methods as: depth map-based, voxel-based, NeRF-based, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based, and large feed-forward methods. Among these, we focus significantly on depth map-based methods, which are the main family of MVS due to their conciseness, flexibility and scalability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature at the time of this writing. We investigate these learning-based methods, summarize their performances on popular benchmarks, and discuss promising future research directions in this area.",

Existing methods lack a comprehensive solution to accurately reconstruct real-world objects with spatial representations and their associated physics attributes.   We propose a Real2Sim pipeline with a hybrid representation model that integrates mesh geometry, 3D Gaussian kernels, and physics attributes to enhance the digital asset representation of robotic arms.   This hybrid representation is implemented through a Gaussian-Mesh-Pixel binding technique, which establishes an isomorphic mapping between mesh vertices and Gaussian models. This enables a fully differentiable rendering pipeline that can be optimized through numerical solvers, achieves high-fidelity rendering via Gaussian Splatting, and facilitates physically plausible simulation of the robotic arm's interaction with its environment using mesh-based methods.

To overcome this, we propose the Avatar Concept Slider (ACS), a 3D avatar editing method that allows precise manipulation of semantic concepts in human avatars towards a specified intermediate point between two extremes of concepts, akin to moving a knob along a slider track. To achieve this, our ACS has three designs. 1) A Concept Sliding Loss based on Linear Discriminant Analysis to pinpoint the concept-specific axis for precise editing. 2) An Attribute Preserving Loss based on Principal Component Analysis for improved preservation of avatar identity during editing. 3) A 3D Gaussian Splatting primitive selection mechanism based on concept-sensitivity, which updates only the primitives that are the most sensitive to our target concept, to improve efficiency. Results demonstrate that our ACS enables fine-grained 3D avatar editing with efficient feedback, without harming the avatar quality or compromising the avatar's identifying attributes.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic scene reconstruction has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its capabilities in high-quality and real-time rendering. Among various methodologies, constructing a 4D spatial-temporal representation, such as 4D-GS, has gained popularity for its high-quality rendered images. However, these methods often produce suboptimal surfaces, as the discrete 3D Gaussian point clouds fail to align with the object's surface precisely. To address this problem, we propose DynaSurfGS to achieve both photorealistic rendering and high-fidelity surface reconstruction of dynamic scenarios. Specifically, the DynaSurfGS framework first incorporates Gaussian features from 4D neural voxels with the planar-based Gaussian Splatting to facilitate precise surface reconstruction. It leverages normal regularization to enforce the smoothness of the surface of dynamic objects. It also incorporates the as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) constraint to maintain the approximate rigidity of local neighborhoods of 3D Gaussians between timesteps and ensure that adjacent 3D Gaussians remain closely aligned throughout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaSurfGS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both high-fidelity surface reconstruction and photorealistic rendering.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce Splatt3R, a pose-free, feed-forward method for in-the-wild 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis from stereo pairs. Given uncalibrated natural images, Splatt3R can predict 3D Gaussian Splats without requiring any camera parameters or depth information. For generalizability, we build Splatt3R upon a ``foundation'' 3D geometry reconstruction method, MASt3R, by extending it to deal with both 3D structure and appearance. Specifically, unlike the original MASt3R which reconstructs only 3D point clouds, we predict the additional Gaussian attributes required to construct a Gaussian primitive for each point. Hence, unlike other novel view synthesis methods, Splatt3R is first trained by optimizing the 3D point cloud's geometry loss, and then a novel view synthesis objective. By doing this, we avoid the local minima present in training 3D Gaussian Splats from stereo views. We also propose a novel loss masking strategy that we empirically find is critical for strong performance on extrapolated viewpoints. We train Splatt3R on the ScanNet++ dataset and demonstrate excellent generalisation to uncalibrated, in-the-wild images. Splatt3R can reconstruct scenes at 4FPS at 512 x 512 resolution, and the resultant splats can be rendered in real-time.",

    "abstract": "The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Peculiar Velocity Survey aims to measure the peculiar velocities of early and late type galaxies within the DESI footprint using both the Fundamental Plane and Tully-Fisher relations. Direct measurements of peculiar velocities can significantly improve constraints on the growth rate of structure, reducing uncertainty by a factor of approximately 2.5 at redshift 0.1 compared to the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey's redshift space distortion measurements alone. We assess the quality of stellar velocity dispersion measurements from DESI spectroscopic data. These measurements, along with photometric data from the Legacy Survey, establish the Fundamental Plane relation and determine distances and peculiar velocities of early-type galaxies. During Survey Validation, we obtain spectra for 6698 unique early-type galaxies, up to a photometric redshift of 0.15. 64\\% of observed galaxies (4267) have relative velocity dispersion errors below 10\\%. This percentage increases to 75\\% if we restrict our sample to galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts below 0.1. We use the measured central velocity dispersion, along with photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, to fit the Fundamental Plane parameters using a 3D Gaussian maximum likelihood algorithm that accounts for measurement uncertainties and selection cuts. In addition, we conduct zero-point calibration using the absolute distance measurements to the Coma cluster, leading to a value of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 76.05 \\pm 0.35$(statistical) $\\pm 0.49$(systematic FP) $\\pm 4.86$(statistical due to calibration) $\\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$.

To address this challenge, we proposed a novel text-driven 3D-consistent scene generation model: SceneDreamer360. Our proposed method leverages a text-driven panoramic image generation model as a prior for 3D scene generation and employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to ensure consistency across multi-view panoramic images.

During the 3D scene construction, a novel point cloud fusion initialization method is used, producing higher quality and spatially consistent point clouds. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to other methods, SceneDreamer360 with its panoramic image generation and 3DGS can produce higher quality, spatially consistent, and visually appealing 3D scenes from any text prompt.

A desired virtual 3D scene should 1) exhibit omnidirectional view consistency, and 2) allow for free exploration in complex scene hierarchies. Existing methods either rely on successive scene expansion via inpainting or employ panorama representation to represent large FOV scene environments. However, the generated scene suffers from semantic drift during expansion and is unable to handle occlusion among scene hierarchies. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LayerPano3D, a novel framework for full-view, explorable panoramic 3D scene generation from a single text prompt. Our key insight is to decompose a reference 2D panorama into multiple layers at different depth levels, where each layer reveals the unseen space from the reference views via diffusion prior. LayerPano3D comprises multiple dedicated designs: 1) we introduce a novel text-guided anchor view synthesis pipeline for high-quality, consistent panorama generation. 2) We pioneer the Layered 3D Panorama as underlying representation to manage complex scene hierarchies and lift it into 3D Gaussians to splat detailed 360-degree omnidirectional scenes with unconstrained viewing paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates state-of-the-art 3D panoramic scene in both full view consistency and immersive exploratory experience. We believe that LayerPano3D holds promise for advancing 3D panoramic scene creation with numerous applications.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) method has achieved great success in novel view synthesis, providing real-time rendering while ensuring high-quality rendering results. However, this method faces challenges in modeling specular reflections and handling anisotropic appearance components, especially in dealing with view-dependent color under complex lighting conditions. Additionally, 3D-GS uses spherical harmonic to learn the color representation, which has limited ability to represent complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Lantent-SpecGS, an approach that utilizes a universal latent neural descriptor within each 3D Gaussian. This enables a more effective representation of 3D feature fields, including appearance and geometry. Moreover, two parallel CNNs are designed to decoder the splatting feature maps into diffuse color and specular color separately. A mask that depends on the viewpoint is learned to merge these two colors, resulting in the final rendered image. Experimental results demonstrate that our method obtains competitive performance in novel view synthesis and extends the ability of 3D-GS to handle intricate scenarios with specular reflections.",

    "abstract": "Using the latent diffusion model has proven effective in developing novel 3D generation techniques. To harness the latent diffusion model, a key challenge is designing a high-fidelity and efficient representation that links the latent space and the 3D space. In this paper, we introduce Atlas Gaussians, a novel representation for feed-forward native 3D generation. Atlas Gaussians represent a shape as the union of local patches, and each patch can decode 3D Gaussians. We parameterize a patch as a sequence of feature vectors and design a learnable function to decode 3D Gaussians from the feature vectors. In this process, we incorporate UV-based sampling, enabling the generation of a sufficiently large, and theoretically infinite, number of 3D Gaussian points. The large amount of 3D Gaussians enables the generation of high-quality details. Moreover, due to local awareness of the representation, the transformer-based decoding procedure operates on a patch level, ensuring efficiency. We train a variational autoencoder to learn the Atlas Gaussians representation, and then apply a latent diffusion model on its latent space for learning 3D Generation. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the prior arts of feed-forward native 3D generation.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic scene reconstruction using Gaussians has recently attracted increased interest. Mainstream approaches typically employ a global deformation field to warp a 3D scene in canonical space. However, the inherent low-frequency nature of implicit neural fields often leads to ineffective representations of complex motions. Moreover, their structural rigidity can hinder adaptation to scenes with varying resolutions and durations. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach for streaming 4D real-world reconstruction utilizing discrete 3D control points. This method physically models local rays and establishes a motion-decoupling coordinate system. By effectively merging traditional graphics with learnable pipelines, it provides a robust and efficient local 6-degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) motion representation. Additionally, we have developed a generalized framework that integrates our control points with Gaussians. Starting from an initial 3D reconstruction, our workflow decomposes the streaming 4D reconstruction into four independent submodules: 3D segmentation, 3D control point generation, object-wise motion manipulation, and residual compensation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D Gaussian splatting techniques on both the Neu3DV and CMU-Panoptic datasets. Notably, the optimization of our 3D control points is achievable in 100 iterations and within just 2 seconds per frame on a single NVIDIA 4070 GPU.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves fast and high-quality renderings by using numerous small Gaussians, which leads to significant memory consumption. This reliance on a large number of Gaussians restricts the application of 3DGS-based models on low-cost devices due to memory limitations. However, simply reducing the number of Gaussians to accommodate devices with less memory capacity leads to inferior quality compared to the quality that can be achieved on high-end hardware. To address this lack of scalability, we propose integrating a Flexible Level of Detail (FLoD) to 3DGS, to allow a scene to be rendered at varying levels of detail according to hardware capabilities. While existing 3DGSs with LoD focus on detailed reconstruction, our method provides reconstructions using a small number of Gaussians for reduced memory requirements, and a larger number of Gaussians for greater detail. Experiments demonstrate our various rendering options with tradeoffs between rendering quality and memory usage, thereby allowing real-time rendering across different memory constraints. Furthermore, we show that our method generalizes to different 3DGS frameworks, indicating its potential for integration into future state-of-the-art developments.

    "abstract": "Traditional volumetric fusion algorithms preserve the spatial structure of 3D scenes, which is beneficial for many tasks in computer vision and robotics. However, they often lack realism in terms of visualization. Emerging 3D Gaussian splatting bridges this gap, but existing Gaussian-based reconstruction methods often suffer from artifacts and inconsistencies with the underlying 3D structure, and struggle with real-time optimization, unable to provide users with immediate feedback in high quality. One of the bottlenecks arises from the massive amount of Gaussian parameters that need to be updated during optimization. Instead of using 3D Gaussian as a standalone map representation, we incorporate it into a volumetric mapping system to take advantage of geometric information and propose to use a quadtree data structure on images to drastically reduce the number of splats initialized. In this way, we simultaneously generate a compact 3D Gaussian map with fewer artifacts and a volumetric map on the fly. Our method, GSFusion, significantly enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing rendering quality, as demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets.

While 3D Gaussians efficiently approximate an object's surface, they fail to capture the volumetric properties of subsurface scattering. We propose a framework for optimizing an object's shape together with the radiance transfer field given multi-view OLAT (one light at a time) data. Our method decomposes the scene into an explicit surface represented as 3D Gaussians, with a spatially varying BRDF, and an implicit volumetric representation of the scattering component. A learned incident light field accounts for shadowing. We optimize all parameters jointly via ray-traced differentiable rendering. Our approach enables material editing, relighting and novel view synthesis at interactive rates. We show successful application on synthetic data and introduce a newly acquired multi-view multi-light dataset of objects in a light-stage setup. Compared to previous work we achieve comparable or better results at a fraction of optimization and rendering time while enabling detailed control over material attributes.

Distractors have severe impact on the rendering quality as they get represented as view-dependent effects or result in floating artifacts. Our goal is to identify and ignore such distractors during the 3D Gaussian optimization to obtain a clean reconstruction. To this end, we take a self-supervised approach that looks at the image residuals during the optimization to determine areas that have likely been falsified by a distractor. In addition, we leverage a pretrained segmentation network to provide object awareness, enabling more accurate exclusion of distractors. This way, we obtain segmentation masks of distractors to effectively ignore them in the loss formulation. We demonstrate that our approach is robust to various distractors and strongly improves rendering quality on distractor-polluted scenes, improving PSNR by 1.86dB compared to 3D Gaussian Splatting.",

To address this limitation, we propose Gaussian Splatting for Projection (GSP) module to provide accurate scale information for fully self-supervised training from adjacent view projection. Additionally, existing methods rely on volume rendering for final 3D voxel representation learning using 2D signals (depth maps, semantic maps), which is both time-consuming and less effective.

However, challenges persist in the synthesis of 3D scenes from a single view, primarily due to the complexity of real-world environments and the limited availability of high-quality prior resources. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Pano2Room, designed to automatically reconstruct high-quality 3D indoor scenes from a single panoramic image. These panoramic images can be easily generated using a panoramic RGBD inpainter from captures at a single location with any camera. The key idea is to initially construct a preliminary mesh from the input panorama, and iteratively refine this mesh using a panoramic RGBD inpainter while collecting photo-realistic 3D-consistent pseudo novel views. Finally, the refined mesh is converted into a 3D Gaussian Splatting field and trained with the collected pseudo novel views. This pipeline enables the reconstruction of real-world 3D scenes, even in the presence of large occlusions, and facilitates the synthesis of photo-realistic novel views with detailed geometry. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of our method in single-panorama indoor novel synthesis compared to the state-of-the-art.

However, human perception typically understands 3D objects at a higher level as a composition of parts or structures rather than points or voxels. Representing 3D objects or scenes as semantic parts can benefit further understanding and applications. In this paper, we introduce $\\textbf{PartGS}$, $\\textbf{part}$-aware 3D reconstruction by a hybrid representation of 2D $\\textbf{G}$aussians and $\\textbf{S}$uperquadrics, which parses objects or scenes into semantic parts, digging 3D structural clues from multi-view image inputs. Accurate structured geometry reconstruction and high-quality rendering are achieved at the same time. Our method simultaneously optimizes superquadric meshes and Gaussians by coupling their parameters within our hybrid representation. On one hand, this hybrid representation inherits the advantage of superquadrics to represent different shape primitives, supporting flexible part decomposition of scenes. On the other hand, 2D Gaussians capture complex texture and geometry details, ensuring high-quality appearance and geometry reconstruction. Our method is fully unsupervised and outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in extensive experiments on DTU, ShapeNet, and real-life datasets.",

We present DEGAS, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based modeling method for full-body avatars with rich facial expressions. Trained on multiview videos of a given subject, our method learns a conditional variational autoencoder that takes both the body motion and facial expression as driving signals to generate Gaussian maps in the UV layout. To drive the facial expressions, instead of the commonly used 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) in 3D head avatars, we propose to adopt the expression latent space trained solely on 2D portrait images, bridging the gap between 2D talking faces and 3D avatars. Leveraging the rendering capability of 3DGS and the rich expressiveness of the expression latent space, the learned avatars can be reenacted to reproduce photorealistic rendering images with subtle and accurate facial expressions. Experiments on an existing dataset and our newly proposed dataset of full-body talking avatars demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We also propose an audio-driven extension of our method with the help of 2D talking faces, opening new possibilities to interactive AI agents.",

Furthermore, we propose a novel compression pipeline tailored for both point clouds and 2D feature grids, considering the entropy variations across different levels.

Recently, methods using 3D Gaussians to represent the human body have emerged, offering faster optimization and real-time rendering. However, due to ignoring the crucial role of human body semantic information which represents the explicit topological and intrinsic structure within human body, they fail to achieve fine-detail reconstruction of human avatars. To address this issue, we propose SG-GS, which uses semantics-embedded 3D Gaussians, skeleton-driven rigid deformation, and non-rigid cloth dynamics deformation to create photo-realistic human avatars. We then design a Semantic Human-Body Annotator (SHA) which utilizes SMPL's semantic prior for efficient body part semantic labeling. The generated labels are used to guide the optimization of semantic attributes of Gaussian. To capture the explicit topological structure of the human body, we employ a 3D network that integrates both topological and geometric associations for human avatar deformation. We further implement three key strategies to enhance the semantic accuracy of 3D Gaussians and rendering quality: semantic projection with 2D regularization, semantic-guided density regularization and semantic-aware regularization with neighborhood consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SG-GS achieves state-of-the-art geometry and appearance reconstruction performance.",

Building upon prior skeleton-driven approaches that combine rigid deformation with non-rigid cloth dynamics, we first establish baseline avatars with fundamental 3D consistency. To enhance 3D consistency under sparse inputs, we introduce a Dynamic Avatar Adjustment (DAA) module, which refines deformed Gaussians by leveraging similar poses from the training set. By minimizing the rendering discrepancy between adjusted Gaussians and reference poses, DAA provides additional supervision for avatar reconstruction. We further maintain global 3D consistency through a novel geometry-aware contrastive learning strategy.

Recent SfM-free methods have integrated pose optimization, designing end-to-end frameworks for joint camera pose estimation and NVS. However, most existing works rely on per-pixel image loss functions, such as L2 loss. In SfM-free methods, inaccurate initial poses lead to misalignment issue, which, under the constraints of per-pixel image loss functions, results in excessive gradients, causing unstable optimization and poor convergence for NVS. In this study, we propose a correspondence-guided SfM-free 3D Gaussian splatting for NVS. We use correspondences between the target and the rendered result to achieve better pixel alignment, facilitating the optimization of relative poses between frames. We then apply the learned poses to optimize the entire scene. Each 2D screen-space pixel is associated with its corresponding 3D Gaussians through approximated surface rendering to facilitate gradient back propagation. Experimental results underline the superior performance and time efficiency of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.",

To address these challenges, we first introduce intrinsic diffusion priors to estimate the attributes for physically based rendering. Then we divide the illumination into environmental and direct components for joint optimization. Last, we employ deferred rendering to reduce the computational load. Our framework uses a learnable environment map and Spherical Gaussians (SGs) to represent light sources parametrically, therefore enabling controllable and photorealistic relighting on Gaussian Splatting.

    "abstract": "The underwater 3D scene reconstruction is a challenging, yet interesting problem with applications ranging from naval robots to VR experiences. The problem was successfully tackled by fully volumetric NeRF-based methods which can model both the geometry and the medium (water). Unfortunately, these methods are slow to train and do not offer real-time rendering. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method offered a fast alternative to NeRFs. However, because it is an explicit method that renders only the geometry, it cannot render the medium and is therefore unsuited for underwater reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a novel approach that fuses volumetric rendering with 3DGS to handle underwater data effectively. Our method employs 3DGS for explicit geometry representation and a separate volumetric field (queried once per pixel) for capturing the scattering medium. This dual representation further allows the restoration of the scenes by removing the scattering medium. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods in rendering quality on the underwater SeaThru-NeRF dataset. Furthermore, it does so while offering real-time rendering performance, addressing the efficiency limitations of existing methods. Web: https://water-splatting.github.io",

    "abstract": "We propose progressive radiance distillation, an inverse rendering method that combines physically-based rendering with Gaussian-based radiance field rendering using a distillation progress map. Taking multi-view images as input, our method starts from a pre-trained radiance field guidance, and distills physically-based light and material parameters from the radiance field using an image-fitting process. The distillation progress map is initialized to a small value, which favors radiance field rendering. During early iterations when fitted light and material parameters are far from convergence, the radiance field fallback ensures the sanity of image loss gradients and avoids local minima that attracts under-fit states. As fitted parameters converge, the physical model gradually takes over and the distillation progress increases correspondingly. In presence of light paths unmodeled by the physical model, the distillation progress never finishes on affected pixels and the learned radiance field stays in the final rendering. With this designed tolerance for physical model limitations, we prevent unmodeled color components from leaking into light and material parameters, alleviating relighting artifacts. Meanwhile, the remaining radiance field compensates for the limitations of the physical model, guaranteeing high-quality novel views synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques quality-wise in both novel view synthesis and relighting. The idea of progressive radiance distillation is not limited to Gaussian splatting. We show that it also has positive effects for prominently specular scenes when adapted to a mesh-based inverse rendering method.",

To address this gap, we introduce a novel single-image-driven 3D scene editing approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling intuitive manipulation via directly editing the content on a 2D image plane. Our method learns to optimize the 3D Gaussians to align with an edited version of the image rendered from a user-specified viewpoint of the original scene. To capture long-range object deformation, we introduce positional loss into the optimization process of 3D Gaussian Splatting and enable gradient propagation through reparameterization. To handle occluded 3D Gaussians when rendering from the specified viewpoint, we build an anchor-based structure and employ a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy capable of handling long-range deformation while maintaining structural stability. Furthermore, we design a novel masking strategy to adaptively identify non-rigid deformation regions for fine-scale modeling. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in handling geometric details, long-range, and non-rigid deformation, demonstrating superior editing flexibility and quality compared to previous approaches.",

This paper revisits the problem set to pursue a better 3D understanding of a scene modeled by NeRFs and 3DGS as follows. 1) We directly supervise the 3D points to train the language embedding field. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without relying on multi-scale language embeddings. 2) We transfer the pre-trained language field to 3DGS, achieving the first real-time rendering speed without sacrificing training time or accuracy. 3) We introduce a 3D querying and evaluation protocol for assessing the reconstructed geometry and semantics together. Code, checkpoints, and annotations will be available online. Project page: https://hyunji12.github.io/Open3DRF",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed substantial advancements in the field of 3D reconstruction from 2D images, particularly following the introduction of the neural radiance field (NeRF) technique. However, reconstructing a 3D high dynamic range (HDR) radiance field, which aligns more closely with real-world conditions, from 2D multi-exposure low dynamic range (LDR) images continues to pose significant challenges. Approaches to this issue fall into two categories: grid-based and implicit-based. Implicit methods, using multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), face inefficiencies, limited solvability, and overfitting risks. Conversely, grid-based methods require significant memory and struggle with image quality and long training times. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Splatting-a recent, high-quality, real-time 3D reconstruction technique-into this domain. We further develop the High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting (HDR-GS) method, designed to address the aforementioned challenges. This method enhances color dimensionality by including luminance and uses an asymmetric grid for tone-mapping, swiftly and precisely converting pixel irradiance to color. Our approach improves HDR scene recovery accuracy and integrates a novel coarse-to-fine strategy to speed up model convergence, enhancing robustness against sparse viewpoints and exposure extremes, and preventing local optima. Extensive testing confirms that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.",

However, the trained Gaussians suffer from severe zooming degradation due to non-adjustable representation derived from single-scale training. Though some methods attempt to tackle this problem via post-processing techniques such as selective rendering or filtering techniques towards primitives, the scale-specific information is not involved in Gaussians. In this paper, we propose a unified optimization method to make Gaussians adaptive for arbitrary scales by self-adjusting the primitive properties (e.g., color, shape and size) and distribution (e.g., position). Inspired by the mipmap technique, we design pseudo ground-truth for the target scale and propose a scale-consistency guidance loss to inject scale information into 3D Gaussians. Our method is a plug-in module, applicable for any 3DGS models to solve the zoom-in and zoom-out aliasing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, our method outperforms 3DGS in PSNR by an average of 9.25 dB for zoom-in and 10.40 dB for zoom-out on the NeRF Synthetic dataset.",

Traditional manual operation of drones in GPS-denied environments, such as industrial facilities and infrastructure, is labour-intensive, tedious and prone to error. This study presents an innovative framework for smart MAV inspections in such complex and GPS-denied indoor environments. The framework features a hierarchical perception and planning system that identifies regions of interest and optimises task paths. It also presents an advanced MAV system with enhanced localisation and motion planning capabilities, integrated with Neural Reconstruction technology for comprehensive 3D reconstruction of building structures.

The main structure consists of columns and walls. Experimental results show that our MAV system performs exceptionally well in autonomous inspection tasks, achieving a 100\\% success rate in generating and executing scan paths. Extensive experiments validate the manoeuvrability of our developed MAV, achieving a 100\\% success rate in motion planning with a tracking error of less than 0.1 metres.

The prior learning phase leverages 3D head priors derived from a large-scale multi-view dynamic dataset, and the avatar creation phase applies these priors for few-shot personalization. Our approach effectively captures these priors by utilizing a Gaussian Splatting-based auto-decoder network with part-based dynamic modeling. Our method employs identity-shared encoding with personalized latent codes for individual identities to learn the attributes of Gaussian primitives.

    "abstract": "Conventional geometry-based SLAM systems lack dense 3D reconstruction capabilities since their data association usually relies on feature correspondences. Additionally, learning-based SLAM systems often fall short in terms of real-time performance and accuracy. Balancing real-time performance with dense 3D reconstruction capabilities is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a real-time RGB-D SLAM system that incorporates a novel view synthesis technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting, for 3D scene representation and pose estimation. This technique leverages the real-time rendering performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting with rasterization and allows for differentiable optimization in real time through CUDA implementation. We also enable mesh reconstruction from 3D Gaussians for explicit dense 3D reconstruction. To estimate accurate camera poses, we utilize a rotation-translation decoupled strategy with inverse optimization. This involves iteratively updating both in several iterations through gradient-based optimization. This process includes differentiably rendering RGB, depth, and silhouette maps and updating the camera parameters to minimize a combined loss of photometric loss, depth geometry loss, and visibility loss, given the existing 3D Gaussian map. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles to accurately represent surfaces due to the multi-view inconsistency of 3D Gaussians, which can lead to reduced accuracy in both camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction. To address this, we utilize depth priors as additional regularization to enforce geometric constraints, thereby improving the accuracy of both pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. We also provide extensive experimental results on public benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in terms of pose accuracy, geometric accuracy, and rendering performance.",

In particular, with the pretrained diffusion models, existing methods predominantly use Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to train 3D models such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). However, a hurdle is that they often encounter difficulties with over-smoothing textures and over-saturating colors. The rectified flow model -- which utilizes a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) to represent a straight trajectory -- shows promise as an alternative prior to text-to-3D generation. It learns a time-independent vector field, thereby reducing the ambiguity in 3D model update gradients that are calculated using time-dependent scores in the SDS framework. In light of this, we first develop a mathematical analysis to seamlessly integrate SDS with rectified flow model, paving the way for our initial framework known as Vector Field Distillation Sampling (VFDS). However, empirical findings indicate that VFDS still results in over-smoothing outcomes. Therefore, we analyze the grounding reasons for such a failure from the perspective of ODE trajectories. On top, we propose a novel framework, named FlowDreamer, which yields high fidelity results with richer textual details and faster convergence. The key insight is to leverage the coupling and reversible properties of the rectified flow model to search for the corresponding noise, rather than using randomly sampled noise as in VFDS. Accordingly, we introduce a novel Unique Couple Matching (UCM) loss, which guides the 3D model to optimize along the same trajectory.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an alternative representation that leverages a 3D Gaussian-based representation and introduces an approximated volumetric rendering, achieving very fast rendering speed and promising image quality. Furthermore, subsequent studies have successfully extended 3DGS to dynamic 3D scenes, demonstrating its wide range of applications. However, a significant drawback arises as 3DGS and its following methods entail a substantial number of Gaussians to maintain the high fidelity of the rendered images, which requires a large amount of memory and storage. To address this critical issue, we place a specific emphasis on two key objectives: reducing the number of Gaussian points without sacrificing performance and compressing the Gaussian attributes, such as view-dependent color and covariance. To this end, we propose a learnable mask strategy that significantly reduces the number of Gaussians while preserving high performance. In addition, we propose a compact but effective representation of view-dependent color by employing a grid-based neural field rather than relying on spherical harmonics. Finally, we learn codebooks to compactly represent the geometric and temporal attributes by residual vector quantization. With model compression techniques such as quantization and entropy coding, we consistently show over 25x reduced storage and enhanced rendering speed compared to 3DGS for static scenes, while maintaining the quality of the scene representation. For dynamic scenes, our approach achieves more than 12x storage efficiency and retains a high-quality reconstruction compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for 3D scene representation, achieving high performance, fast training, compactness, and real-time rendering.

    "abstract": "The use of 3D Gaussians as representation of radiance fields has enabled high quality novel view synthesis at real-time rendering speed. However, the choice of optimising the outgoing radiance of each Gaussian independently as spherical harmonics results in unsatisfactory view dependent effects. In response to these limitations, our work, Factorised Tensorial Illumination for 3D Gaussian Splatting, or 3iGS, improves upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering quality. Instead of optimising a single outgoing radiance parameter, 3iGS enhances 3DGS view-dependent effects by expressing the outgoing radiance as a function of a local illumination field and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) features. We optimise a continuous incident illumination field through a Tensorial Factorisation representation, while separately fine-tuning the BRDF features of each 3D Gaussian relative to this illumination field. Our methodology significantly enhances the rendering quality of specular view-dependent effects of 3DGS, while maintaining rapid training and rendering speeds.",

However, the current relighting method based on 3DGS still struggles to compute high-quality shadow and indirect illumination in real time for dynamic light, leading to unrealistic rendering results. We solve this problem by precomputing the expensive transport simulations required for complex transfer functions like shadowing, the resulting transfer functions are represented as dense sets of vectors or matrices for every Gaussian splat.

Our comprehensive evaluation on the WayveScenes101 dataset demonstrates that LLM-guided segmentation significantly outperforms traditional approaches based on predefined canonical phrases. Notably, our fine-tuned smaller models achieve performance comparable to larger expert models while maintaining faster inference times. Through ablation studies, we discover that the effectiveness of helping positive words correlates with model scale, with larger models better equipped to leverage additional semantic information.

    "abstract": "Text-to-3D content creation has recently received much attention, especially with the prevalence of 3D Gaussians Splatting. In general, GS-based methods comprise two key stages: initialization and rendering optimization. To achieve initialization, existing works directly apply random sphere initialization or 3D diffusion models, e.g., Point-E, to derive the initial shapes. However, such strategies suffer from two critical yet challenging problems: 1) the final shapes are still similar to the initial ones even after training; 2) shapes can be produced only from simple texts, e.g., \"a dog\", not for lexically richer texts, e.g., \"a dog is sitting on the top of the airplane\". To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel general framework to boost the 3D GS Initialization for text-to-3D generation upon the lexical richness. Our key idea is to aggregate 3D Gaussians into spatially uniform voxels to represent complex shapes while enabling the spatial interaction among the 3D Gaussians and semantic interaction between Gaussians and texts. Specifically, we first construct a voxelized representation, where each voxel holds a 3D Gaussian with its position, scale, and rotation fixed while setting opacity as the sole factor to determine a position's occupancy. We then design an initialization network mainly consisting of two novel components: 1) Global Information Perception (GIP) block and 2) Gaussians-Text Fusion (GTF) block. Such a design enables each 3D Gaussian to assimilate the spatial information from other areas and semantic information from texts. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our framework of high-quality 3D GS initialization against the existing methods, e.g., Shap-E, by taking lexically simple, medium, and hard texts. Also, our framework can be seamlessly plugged into SoTA training frameworks, e.g., LucidDreamer, for semantically consistent text-to-3D generation.",

This performance drop is mainly caused by the limited number of initial points generated from the sparse input, insufficient supervision during the training process, and inadequate regularization of the oversized Gaussian ellipsoids. To handle these issues, we propose the LoopSparseGS, a loop-based 3DGS framework for the sparse novel view synthesis task. In specific, we propose a loop-based Progressive Gaussian Initialization (PGI) strategy that could iteratively densify the initialized point cloud using the rendered pseudo images during the training process. Then, the sparse and reliable depth from the Structure from Motion, and the window-based dense monocular depth are leveraged to provide precise geometric supervision via the proposed Depth-alignment Regularization (DAR). Additionally, we introduce a novel Sparse-friendly Sampling (SFS) strategy to handle oversized Gaussian ellipsoids leading to large pixel errors. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that LoopSparseGS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for sparse-input novel view synthesis, across indoor, outdoor, and object-level scenes with various image resolutions.",

    "abstract": "Recent text-guided generation of individual 3D object has achieved great success using diffusion priors. However, these methods are not suitable for object insertion and replacement tasks as they do not consider the background, leading to illumination mismatches within the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce an illumination-aware 3D scene editing pipeline for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. Our key observation is that inpainting by the state-of-the-art conditional 2D diffusion model is consistent with background in lighting. To leverage the prior knowledge from the well-trained diffusion models for 3D object generation, our approach employs a coarse-to-fine objection optimization pipeline with inpainted views. In the first coarse step, we achieve image-to-3D lifting given an ideal inpainted view. The process employs 3D-aware diffusion prior from a view-conditioned diffusion model, which preserves illumination present in the conditioning image. To acquire an ideal inpainted image, we introduce an Anchor View Proposal (AVP) algorithm to find a single view that best represents the scene illumination in target region. In the second Texture Enhancement step, we introduce a novel Depth-guided Inpainting Score Distillation Sampling (DI-SDS), which enhances geometry and texture details with the inpainting diffusion prior, beyond the scope of the 3D-aware diffusion prior knowledge in the first coarse step. DI-SDS not only provides fine-grained texture enhancement, but also urges optimization to respect scene lighting. Our approach efficiently achieves local editing with global illumination consistency without explicitly modeling light transport. We demonstrate robustness of our method by evaluating editing in real scenes containing explicit highlight and shadows, and compare against the state-of-the-art text-to-3D editing methods.",

Nevertheless, most of the 3D human avatars modeled from a casually captured video only support body motions without facial expressions and hand motions.In this work, we present ExAvatar, an expressive whole-body 3D human avatar learned from a short monocular video. We design ExAvatar as a combination of the whole-body parametric mesh model (SMPL-X) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The main challenges are 1) a limited diversity of facial expressions and poses in the video and 2) the absence of 3D observations, such as 3D scans and RGBD images. The limited diversity in the video makes animations with novel facial expressions and poses non-trivial. In addition, the absence of 3D observations could cause significant ambiguity in human parts that are not observed in the video, which can result in noticeable artifacts under novel motions. To address them, we introduce our hybrid representation of the mesh and 3D Gaussians. Our hybrid representation treats each 3D Gaussian as a vertex on the surface with pre-defined connectivity information (i.e., triangle faces) between them following the mesh topology of SMPL-X. It makes our ExAvatar animatable with novel facial expressions by driven by the facial expression space of SMPL-X. In addition, by using connectivity-based regularizers, we significantly reduce artifacts in novel facial expressions and poses.",

    "abstract": "Current visual foundation models are trained purely on unstructured 2D data, limiting their understanding of 3D structure of objects and scenes. In this work, we show that fine-tuning on 3D-aware data improves the quality of emerging semantic features. We design a method to lift semantic 2D features into an efficient 3D Gaussian representation, which allows us to re-render them for arbitrary views. Using the rendered 3D-aware features, we design a fine-tuning strategy to transfer such 3D awareness into a 2D foundation model. We demonstrate that models fine-tuned in that way produce features that readily improve downstream task performance in semantic segmentation and depth estimation through simple linear probing. Notably, though fined-tuned on a single indoor dataset, the improvement is transferable to a variety of indoor datasets and out-of-domain datasets. We hope our study encourages the community to consider injecting 3D awareness when training 2D foundation models. Project page: https://ywyue.github.io/FiT3D.",

    "abstract": "The recent advance in neural rendering has enabled the ability to reconstruct high-quality 4D scenes using neural networks. Although 4D neural reconstruction is popular, registration for such representations remains a challenging task, especially for dynamic scene registration in surgical planning and simulation. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for dynamic surgical neural scene registration. We first utilize 4D Gaussian Splatting to represent the surgical scene and capture both static and dynamic scenes effectively. Then, a spatial aware feature aggregation method, Spatially Weight Cluttering (SWC) is proposed to accurately align the feature between surgical scenes, enabling precise and realistic surgical simulations. Lastly, we present a novel strategy of deformable scene registration to register two dynamic scenes. By incorporating both spatial and temporal information for correspondence matching, our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing registration methods for implicit neural representation. The proposed method has the potential to improve surgical planning and training, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.",

Their ability to synthesize new viewpoints with photo-realistic quality, as well as capture complex volumetric and specular scenes, makes them an ideal visualization for robotic teleoperation setups. Direct camera teleoperation provides high-fidelity operation at the cost of maneuverability, while reconstruction-based approaches offer controllable scenes with lower fidelity. With this in mind, we propose replacing the traditional reconstruction-visualization components of the robotic teleoperation pipeline with online Radiance Fields, offering highly maneuverable scenes with photorealistic quality. As such, there are three main contributions to state of the art: (1) online training of Radiance Fields using live data from multiple cameras, (2) support for a variety of radiance methods including NeRF and 3DGS, (3) visualization suite for these methods including a virtual reality scene. To enable seamless integration with existing setups, these components were tested with multiple robots in multiple configurations and were displayed using traditional tools as well as the VR headset. The results across methods and robots were compared quantitatively to a baseline of mesh reconstruction, and a user study was conducted to compare the different visualization methods.

    "abstract": "The creation of high-quality 3D assets is paramount for applications in digital heritage preservation, entertainment, and robotics. Traditionally, this process necessitates skilled professionals and specialized software for the modeling, texturing, and rendering of 3D objects. However, the rising demand for 3D assets in gaming and virtual reality (VR) has led to the creation of accessible image-to-3D technologies, allowing non-professionals to produce 3D content and decreasing dependence on expert input. Existing methods for 3D content generation struggle to simultaneously achieve detailed textures and strong geometric consistency. We introduce a novel 3D content creation framework, ScalingGaussian, which combines 3D and 2D diffusion models to achieve detailed textures and geometric consistency in generated 3D assets. Initially, a 3D diffusion model generates point clouds, which are then densified through a process of selecting local regions, introducing Gaussian noise, followed by using local density-weighted selection. To refine the 3D gaussians, we utilize a 2D diffusion model with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss, guiding the 3D Gaussians to clone and split. Finally, the 3D Gaussians are converted into meshes, and the surface textures are optimized using Mean Square Error(MSE) and Gradient Profile Prior(GPP) losses. Our method addresses the common issue of sparse point clouds in 3D diffusion, resulting in improved geometric structure and detailed textures. Experiments on image-to-3D tasks demonstrate that our approach efficiently generates high-quality 3D assets.",

    "abstract": "Implicit neural representations (INRs) have significantly advanced the field of arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) of images. Most existing INR-based ASSR networks first extract features from the given low-resolution image using an encoder, and then render the super-resolved result via a multi-layer perceptron decoder. Although these approaches have shown promising results, their performance is constrained by the limited representation ability of discrete latent codes in the encoded features. In this paper, we propose a novel ASSR method named GaussianSR that overcomes this limitation through 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). Unlike traditional methods that treat pixels as discrete points, GaussianSR represents each pixel as a continuous Gaussian field. The encoded features are simultaneously refined and upsampled by rendering the mutually stacked Gaussian fields. As a result, long-range dependencies are established to enhance representation ability. In addition, a classifier is developed to dynamically assign Gaussian kernels to all pixels to further improve flexibility. All components of GaussianSR (i.e., encoder, classifier, Gaussian kernels, and decoder) are jointly learned end-to-end. Experiments demonstrate that GaussianSR achieves superior ASSR performance with fewer parameters than existing methods while enjoying interpretable and content-aware feature aggregations.",

This paper introduces a novel neural rendering method termed Decoupled Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (DHGS), targeting at promoting the rendering quality of novel view synthesis for static driving scenes. The novelty of this work lies in the decoupled and hybrid pixel-level blender for road and non-road layers, without the conventional unified differentiable rendering logic for the entire scene. Still, consistency and continuity in superimposition are preserved through the proposed depth-ordered hybrid rendering strategy. Additionally, an implicit road representation comprised of a Signed Distance Function (SDF) is trained to supervise the road surface with subtle geometric attributes. Accompanied by the use of auxiliary transmittance loss and consistency loss, novel images with imperceptible boundary and elevated fidelity are ultimately obtained. Substantial experiments on the Waymo dataset prove that DHGS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "The recent advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized the 3D scene reconstruction space enabling high-fidelity novel view synthesis in real-time. However, with the exception of RawNeRF, all prior 3DGS and NeRF-based methods rely on 8-bit tone-mapped Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images for scene reconstruction. Such methods struggle to achieve accurate reconstructions in scenes that require a higher dynamic range. Examples include scenes captured in nighttime or poorly lit indoor spaces having a low signal-to-noise ratio, as well as daylight scenes with shadow regions exhibiting extreme contrast. Our proposed method HDRSplat tailors 3DGS to train directly on 14-bit linear raw images in near darkness which preserves the scenes' full dynamic range and content. Our key contributions are two-fold: Firstly, we propose a linear HDR space-suited loss that effectively extracts scene information from noisy dark regions and nearly saturated bright regions simultaneously, while also handling view-dependent colors without increasing the degree of spherical harmonics. Secondly, through careful rasterization tuning, we implicitly overcome the heavy reliance and sensitivity of 3DGS on point cloud initialization. This is critical for accurate reconstruction in regions of low texture, high depth of field, and low illumination. HDRSplat is the fastest method to date that does 14-bit (HDR) 3D scene reconstruction in $\\le$15 minutes/scene ($\\sim$30x faster than prior state-of-the-art RawNeRF). It also boasts the fastest inference speed at $\\ge$120fps. We further demonstrate the applicability of our HDR scene reconstruction by showcasing various applications like synthetic defocus, dense depth map extraction, and post-capture control of exposure, tone-mapping and view-point.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel approach for 3D indoor scene reconstruction that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with mesh representations. We use meshes for the room layout of the indoor scene, such as walls, ceilings, and floors, while employing 3D Gaussians for other objects. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both representations, offering enhanced flexibility and ease of editing. However, joint training of meshes and 3D Gaussians is challenging because it is not clear which primitive should affect which part of the rendered image. Objects close to the room layout often struggle during training, particularly when the room layout is textureless, which can lead to incorrect optimizations and unnecessary 3D Gaussians. To overcome these challenges, we employ Segment Anything Model (SAM) to guide the selection of primitives. The SAM mask loss enforces each instance to be represented by either Gaussians or meshes, ensuring clear separation and stable training. Furthermore, we introduce an additional densification stage without resetting the opacity after the standard densification. This stage mitigates the degradation of image quality caused by a limited number of 3D Gaussians after the standard densification.",

Instead, our method estimates a 6DoF pose by inverting the 3DGS rendering process. Starting from the object surface, we define a radiant Ellicell that uniformly generates rays departing from each ellipsoid that parameterize the 3DGS model. Each Ellicell ray is associated with the rendering parameters of each ellipsoid, which in turn is used to obtain the best bindings between the target image pixels and the cast rays. These pixel-ray bindings are then ranked to select the best scoring bundle of rays, which their intersection provides the camera center and, in turn, the camera rotation. The proposed solution obviates the necessity of an \"a priori\" pose for initialization, and it solves 6DoF pose estimation in closed form, without the need for iterations. Moreover, compared to the existing Novel View Synthesis (NVS) baselines for pose estimation, 6DGS can improve the overall average rotational accuracy by 12% and translation accuracy by 22% on real scenes, despite not requiring any initialization pose. At the same time, our method operates near real-time, reaching 15fps on consumer hardware.",

Owing to the powerful generative capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models that provide reliable priors, the creation of 3D scenes using only text prompts has become viable, thereby significantly advancing researches in text-driven 3D scene generation. In order to obtain multiple-view supervision from 2D diffusion models, prevailing methods typically employ the diffusion model to generate an initial local image, followed by iteratively outpainting the local image using diffusion models to gradually generate scenes. Nevertheless, these outpainting-based approaches prone to produce global inconsistent scene generation results without high degree of completeness, restricting their broader applications. To tackle these problems, we introduce HoloDreamer, a framework that first generates high-definition panorama as a holistic initialization of the full 3D scene, then leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to quickly reconstruct the 3D scene, thereby facilitating the creation of view-consistent and fully enclosed 3D scenes. Specifically, we propose Stylized Equirectangular Panorama Generation, a pipeline that combines multiple diffusion models to enable stylized and detailed equirectangular panorama generation from complex text prompts. Subsequently, Enhanced Two-Stage Panorama Reconstruction is introduced, conducting a two-stage optimization of 3D-GS to inpaint the missing region and enhance the integrity of the scene. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms prior works in terms of overall visual consistency and harmony as well as reconstruction quality and rendering robustness when generating fully enclosed scenes.",

    "abstract": "Computer vision technologies markedly enhance the automation capabilities of robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) through advanced tool tracking, detection, and localization. However, the limited availability of comprehensive surgical datasets for training represents a significant challenge in this field. This research introduces a novel method that employs 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate synthetic surgical datasets. We propose a method for extracting and combining 3D Gaussian representations of surgical instruments and background operating environments, transforming and combining them to generate high-fidelity synthetic surgical scenarios. We developed a data recording system capable of acquiring images alongside tool and camera poses in a surgical scene. Using this pose data, we synthetically replicate the scene, thereby enabling direct comparisons of the synthetic image quality (29.592 PSNR). As a further validation, we compared two YOLOv5 models trained on the synthetic and real data, respectively, and assessed their performance in an unseen real-world test dataset. Comparing the performances, we observe an improvement in neural network performance, with the synthetic-trained model outperforming the real-world trained model by 12%, testing both on real-world data.",

    "abstract": "To fill the gap of traditional GS compression method, in this paper, we first propose a simple and effective GS data compression anchor called Graph-based GS Compression (GGSC). GGSC is inspired by graph signal processing theory and uses two branches to compress the primitive center and attributes. We split the whole GS sample via KDTree and clip the high-frequency components after the graph Fourier transform. Followed by quantization, G-PCC and adaptive arithmetic coding are used to compress the primitive center and attribute residual matrix to generate the bitrate file. GGSS is the first work to explore traditional GS compression, with advantages that can reveal the GS distortion characteristics corresponding to typical compression operation, such as high-frequency clipping and quantization. Second, based on GGSC, we create a GS Quality Assessment dataset (GSQA) with 120 samples. A subjective experiment is conducted in a laboratory environment to collect subjective scores after rendering GS into Processed Video Sequences (PVS). We analyze the characteristics of different GS distortions based on Mean Opinion Scores (MOS), demonstrating the sensitivity of different attributes distortion to visual quality. The GGSC code and the dataset, including GS samples, MOS, and PVS, are made publicly available at https://github.com/Qi-Yangsjtu/GGSC.",

    "abstract": "The Bird's-eye View (BeV) representation is widely used for 3D perception from multi-view camera images. It allows to merge features from different cameras into a common space, providing a unified representation of the 3D scene. The key component is the view transformer, which transforms image views into the BeV. However, actual view transformer methods based on geometry or cross-attention do not provide a sufficiently detailed representation of the scene, as they use a sub-sampling of the 3D space that is non-optimal for modeling the fine structures of the environment. In this paper, we propose GaussianBeV, a novel method for transforming image features to BeV by finely representing the scene using a set of 3D gaussians located and oriented in 3D space. This representation is then splattered to produce the BeV feature map by adapting recent advances in 3D representation rendering based on gaussian splatting. GaussianBeV is the first approach to use this 3D gaussian modeling and 3D scene rendering process online, i.e. without optimizing it on a specific scene and directly integrated into a single stage model for BeV scene understanding. Experiments show that the proposed representation is highly effective and place GaussianBeV as the new state-of-the-art on the BeV semantic segmentation task on the nuScenes dataset.",

    "abstract": "Autostereoscopic display, despite decades of development, has not achieved extensive application, primarily due to the daunting challenge of 3D content creation for non-specialists. The emergence of Radiance Field as an innovative 3D representation has markedly revolutionized the domains of 3D reconstruction and generation. This technology greatly simplifies 3D content creation for common users, broadening the applicability of Light Field Displays (LFDs). However, the combination of these two fields remains largely unexplored. The standard paradigm to create optimal content for parallax-based light field displays demands rendering at least 45 slightly shifted views preferably at high resolution per frame, a substantial hurdle for real-time rendering. We introduce DirectL, a novel rendering paradigm for Radiance Fields on 3D displays. We thoroughly analyze the interweaved mapping of spatial rays to screen subpixels, precisely determine the light rays entering the human eye, and propose subpixel repurposing to significantly reduce the pixel count required for rendering. Tailored for the two predominant radiance fields--Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), we propose corresponding optimized rendering pipelines that directly render the light field images instead of multi-view images. Extensive experiments across various displays and user study demonstrate that DirectL accelerates rendering by up to 40 times compared to the standard paradigm without sacrificing visual quality. Its rendering process-only modification allows seamless integration into subsequent radiance field tasks. Finally, we integrate DirectL into diverse applications, showcasing the stunning visual experiences and the synergy between LFDs and Radiance Fields, which unveils tremendous potential for commercialization applications. \\href{direct-l.github.io}{\\textbf{Project Homepage}",

Previous methods utilize end-to-end 3D generation models to initialize 3D Gaussians, multi-view diffusion models to enforce multi-view consistency, and text-to-image diffusion models to refine details with score distillation algorithms. However, these methods exhibit two limitations. Firstly, they encounter conflicts in generation directions since different models aim to produce diverse 3D assets. Secondly, the issue of over-saturation in score distillation has not been thoroughly investigated and solved. To address these limitations, we propose PlacidDreamer, a text-to-3D framework that harmonizes initialization, multi-view generation, and text-conditioned generation with a single multi-view diffusion model, while simultaneously employing a novel score distillation algorithm to achieve balanced saturation. To unify the generation direction, we introduce the Latent-Plane module, a training-friendly plug-in extension that enables multi-view diffusion models to provide fast geometry reconstruction for initialization and enhanced multi-view images to personalize the text-to-image diffusion model. To address the over-saturation problem, we propose to view score distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem and introduce the Balanced Score Distillation algorithm, which offers a Pareto Optimal solution that achieves both rich details and balanced saturation. Extensive experiments validate the outstanding capabilities of our PlacidDreamer. The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/HansenHuang0823/PlacidDreamer}.",

Additionally, we have observed the persistent oversaturation in the rendered views of generated 3D assets. From experiments, we find that it is caused by unwanted accumulated brightness in 3DGS during optimization. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a Brightness-Equalized Generation (BEG) scheme in 3DGS rendering.

While these methods excel at interpolating {\\em within the training data}, the challenge of generalizing to new scenes and objects from very sparse views persists. Specifically, modeling 3D humans from sparse views presents formidable hurdles due to the inherent complexity of human geometry, resulting in inaccurate reconstructions of geometry and textures. To tackle this challenge, this paper leverages recent advancements in Gaussian Splatting and introduces a new method to learn generalizable human Gaussians that allows photorealistic and accurate view-rendering of a new human subject from a limited set of sparse views in a feed-forward manner. A pivotal innovation of our approach involves reformulating the learning of 3D Gaussian parameters into a regression process defined on the 2D UV space of a human template, which allows leveraging the strong geometry prior and the advantages of 2D convolutions. In addition, a multi-scaffold is proposed to effectively represent the offset details. Our method outperforms recent methods on both within-dataset generalization as well as cross-dataset generalization settings.",

Experimental evidence demonstrates that our method not only resolves the issues of rendering quality degradation caused by depth discrepancies but also facilitates direct mesh extraction from dense Gaussian point clouds using the Marching Cubes algorithm.

In this study, we propose Click-Gaussian, which learns distinguishable feature fields of two-level granularity, facilitating segmentation without time-consuming post-processing. We delve into challenges stemming from inconsistently learned feature fields resulting from 2D segmentation obtained independently from a 3D scene. 3D segmentation accuracy deteriorates when 2D segmentation results across the views, primary cues for 3D segmentation, are in conflict. To overcome these issues, we propose Global Feature-guided Learning (GFL). GFL constructs the clusters of global feature candidates from noisy 2D segments across the views, which smooths out noises when training the features of 3D Gaussians.

    "abstract": "Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks, leveraging diffusion models for 3D consistent editing. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality. DreamCatalyst also surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing methods, establishing itself as an effective and model-agnostic 3D editing solution.

Additionally, we accommodate per-frame appearance variation by dedicating explicit variables for image formation steps, namely white balance, exposure time, and camera response function. Through joint optimization of additional variables, the SLAM pipeline produces high-quality images with more accurate trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can be incorporated into recent visual SLAM pipelines using various scene representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting.",

Existing event-based radiance field rendering methods are built on neural radiance field, which is computationally heavy and slow in reconstruction speed. Motivated by the two aspects, we introduce Ev-GS, the first CNI-informed scheme to infer 3D Gaussian splatting from a monocular event camera, enabling efficient novel view synthesis. Leveraging 3D Gaussians with pure event-based supervision, Ev-GS overcomes challenges such as the detection of fast-moving objects and insufficient lighting. Experimental results show that Ev-GS outperforms the method that takes frame-based signals as input by rendering realistic views with reduced blurring and improved visual quality. Moreover, it demonstrates competitive reconstruction quality and reduced computing occupancy compared to existing methods, which paves the way to a highly efficient CNI approach for signal processing.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from 2D images and generating diverse views over time presents a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and temporal dynamics involved. While recent advancements in neural implicit models and dynamic Gaussian Splatting have shown promise, limitations persist, particularly in accurately capturing the underlying geometry of highly dynamic scenes. Some approaches address this by incorporating strong semantic and geometric priors through diffusion models. However, we explore a different avenue by investigating the potential of regularizing the native warp field within the dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework. Our method is grounded on the key intuition that an accurate warp field should produce continuous space-time motions. While enforcing the motion constraints on warp fields is non-trivial, we show that we can exploit knowledge innate to the forward warp field network to derive an analytical velocity field, then time integrate for scene flows to effectively constrain both the 2D motion and 3D positions of the Gaussians. This derived Lucas-Kanade style analytical regularization enables our method to achieve superior performance in reconstructing highly dynamic scenes, even under minimal camera movement, extending the boundaries of what existing dynamic Gaussian Splatting frameworks can achieve.",

Doing so instantly from monocular videos offers scalability to broad class of users and wide-scale applications. In this paper, we present a fast, simple, yet effective method for creating animatable 3D digital humans from monocular videos. Our method utilizes the efficiency of Gaussian splatting to model both 3D geometry and appearance. However, we observed that naively optimizing Gaussian splats results in inaccurate geometry, thereby leading to poor animations. This work achieves and illustrates the need of accurate 3D mesh-type modelling of the human body for animatable digitization through Gaussian splats. This is achieved by developing a novel pipeline that benefits from three key aspects: (a) implicit modelling of surface's displacements and the color's spherical harmonics; (b) binding of 3D Gaussians to the respective triangular faces of the body template; (c) a novel technique to render normals followed by their auxiliary supervision. Our exhaustive experiments on three different benchmark datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art results of our method, in limited time settings. In fact, our method is faster by an order of magnitude (in terms of training time) than its closest competitor. At the same time, we achieve superior rendering and 3D reconstruction performance under the change of poses.",

Solving this open problem is especially relevant for robot deployment in many first-responder scenarios, such as search-and-rescue missions that cover vast spaces. The use of LMMs in these settings is currently hampered by the strict context windows that limit the LMM's input size. We therefore introduce a novel approach that utilizes a datagraph structure, which allows the LMM to iteratively query smaller sections of a large environment. Using the datagraph in conjunction with graph traversal algorithms, we can prioritize the most relevant locations to the query, thereby improving the scalability of 3D scene language tasks. We illustrate the datagraph using 3D scenes, but these can be easily substituted by other dense modalities that represent the environment, such as pointclouds or Gaussian splats. We demonstrate the potential to use the datagraph for two 3D scene language task use cases, in a search-and-rescue mission example.",

By utilizing Gaussian Splatting, we propose a simple and efficient method to decouple body materials and lighting from sparse-view or monocular avatar videos, so that the avatar can be rendered simultaneously under novel viewpoints, poses, and lightings at interactive frame rates (6.9 fps). Specifically, we first obtain the canonical body mesh using a signed distance function and assign attributes to each mesh vertex. The Gaussians in the canonical space then interpolate from nearby body mesh vertices to obtain the attributes. We subsequently deform the Gaussians to the posed space using forward skinning, and combine the learnable environment light with the Gaussian attributes for shading computation. To achieve fast shadow modeling, we rasterize the posed body mesh from dense viewpoints to obtain the visibility. Our approach is not only simple but also fast enough to allow interactive rendering of avatar animation under environmental light changes. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous works, our method can render higher quality results at a faster speed on both synthetic and real datasets.",

In this work, we perform scanpath prediction for 360{\\deg} images in 3D spherical coordinate system and proposed a novel 3D scanpath Transformer named Pathformer3D. Specifically, a 3D Transformer encoder is first used to extract 3D contextual feature representation for the 360{\\deg} image.

Finally, a 3D Gaussian distribution is learned from each fixation embedding, from which the fixation position can be sampled.

With a sequence of images taken by an underwater robot, we build 3DGS recurrently and decompose the caustic with low-pass filtering in each iteration.

Conventional methods construct a text-conditioned 3D scene through a three-stage process, involving pose estimation using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) libraries like COLMAP, initializing the 3D model with unedited images, and iteratively updating the dataset with edited images to achieve a 3D scene with text fidelity. Our framework streamlines the conventional multi-stage 3D editing process into a single-stage workflow by overcoming the reliance on COLMAP and eliminating the cost of model initialization. We apply a diffusion model to edit video frames prior to 3D scene creation by incorporating our designed noise blender module for enhancing multi-view editing consistency, a step that does not require additional training or fine-tuning of T2I diffusion models. 3DEgo utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to create 3D scenes from the multi-view consistent edited frames, capitalizing on the inherent temporal continuity and explicit point cloud data. 3DEgo demonstrates remarkable editing precision, speed, and adaptability across a variety of video sources, as validated by extensive evaluations on six datasets, including our own prepared GS25 dataset.

However, learning a multi-identity representation presents advantages in robustly animating humans under arbitrary poses. We propose to construct a high-order tensor that combines all the learnable 3DGS parameters for all the training identities. By assuming a low-rank structure and factorizing the tensor, we model the complex rigid and non-rigid deformations of multiple subjects in a unified network, significantly reducing the total number of parameters. Our proposed approach leverages information from all the training identities and enables robust animation under challenging unseen poses, outperforming existing approaches. It can also be extended to learn unseen identities.",

    "abstract": "Referenced-based scene stylization that edits the appearance based on a content-aligned reference image is an emerging research area. Starting with a pretrained neural radiance field (NeRF), existing methods typically learn a novel appearance that matches the given style. Despite their effectiveness, they inherently suffer from time-consuming volume rendering, and thus are impractical for many real-time applications. In this work, we propose ReGS, which adapts 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reference-based stylization to enable real-time stylized view synthesis. Editing the appearance of a pretrained 3DGS is challenging as it uses discrete Gaussians as 3D representation, which tightly bind appearance with geometry. Simply optimizing the appearance as prior methods do is often insufficient for modeling continuous textures in the given reference image. To address this challenge, we propose a novel texture-guided control mechanism that adaptively adjusts local responsible Gaussians to a new geometric arrangement, serving for desired texture details. The proposed process is guided by texture clues for effective appearance editing, and regularized by scene depth for preserving original geometric structure. With these novel designs, we show ReGs can produce state-of-the-art stylization results that respect the reference texture while embracing real-time rendering speed for free-view navigation.",

Most existing methods render particles via rasterization, projecting them to screen space tiles for processing in a sorted order. This work instead considers ray tracing the particles, building a bounding volume hierarchy and casting a ray for each pixel using high-performance GPU ray tracing hardware. To efficiently handle large numbers of semi-transparent particles, we describe a specialized rendering algorithm which encapsulates particles with bounding meshes to leverage fast ray-triangle intersections, and shades batches of intersections in depth-order. The benefits of ray tracing are well-known in computer graphics: processing incoherent rays for secondary lighting effects such as shadows and reflections, rendering from highly-distorted cameras common in robotics, stochastically sampling rays, and more. With our renderer, this flexibility comes at little cost compared to rasterization. Experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our approach, as well as several applications in computer graphics and vision. We further propose related improvements to the basic Gaussian representation, including a simple use of generalized kernel functions which significantly reduces particle hit counts.",

    "abstract": "We introduce PICA, a novel representation for high-fidelity animatable clothed human avatars with physics-accurate dynamics, even for loose clothing. Previous neural rendering-based representations of animatable clothed humans typically employ a single model to represent both the clothing and the underlying body. While efficient, these approaches often fail to accurately represent complex garment dynamics, leading to incorrect deformations and noticeable rendering artifacts, especially for sliding or loose garments. Furthermore, previous works represent garment dynamics as pose-dependent deformations and facilitate novel pose animations in a data-driven manner. This often results in outcomes that do not faithfully represent the mechanics of motion and are prone to generating artifacts in out-of-distribution poses. To address these issues, we adopt two individual 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models with different deformation characteristics, modeling the human body and clothing separately. This distinction allows for better handling of their respective motion characteristics. With this representation, we integrate a graph neural network (GNN)-based clothed body physics simulation module to ensure an accurate representation of clothing dynamics. Our method, through its carefully designed features, achieves high-fidelity rendering of clothed human bodies in complex and novel driving poses, significantly outperforming previous methods under the same settings.",

    "abstract": "Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem for large-scale 3D scene scanning and reconstruction. With the help of deep learning, registration methods have evolved significantly, reaching a nearly-mature stage. As the introduction of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), it has become the most popular 3D scene representation as its powerful view synthesis capabilities. Regarding NeRF representation, its registration is also required for large-scale scene reconstruction. However, this topic extremly lacks exploration. This is due to the inherent challenge to model the geometric relationship among two scenes with implicit representations. The existing methods usually convert the implicit representation to explicit representation for further registration. Most recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) is introduced, employing explicit 3D Gaussian. This method significantly enhances rendering speed while maintaining high rendering quality. Given two scenes with explicit GS representations, in this work, we explore the 3D registration task between them. To this end, we propose GaussReg, a novel coarse-to-fine framework, both fast and accurate. The coarse stage follows existing point cloud registration methods and estimates a rough alignment for point clouds from GS. We further newly present an image-guided fine registration approach, which renders images from GS to provide more detailed geometric information for precise alignment. To support comprehensive evaluation, we carefully build a scene-level dataset called ScanNet-GSReg with 1379 scenes obtained from the ScanNet dataset and collect an in-the-wild dataset called GSReg. Experimental results demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. Our GaussReg is 44 times faster than HLoc (SuperPoint as the feature extractor and SuperGlue as the matcher) with comparable accuracy.",

Recent reconstruction methods based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have achieved remarkable results in the reconstruction of surgical scenes. However, based on implicit representation, NeRFs struggle to capture the intricate details of objects in the scene and cannot achieve real-time rendering. In addition, restricted single view perception and occluded instruments also propose special challenges in surgical scene reconstruction. To address these issues, we develop SurgicalGaussian, a deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting method to model dynamic surgical scenes. Our approach models the spatio-temporal features of soft tissues at each time stamp via a forward-mapping deformation MLP and regularization to constrain local 3D Gaussians to comply with consistent movement. With the depth initialization strategy and tool mask-guided training, our method can remove surgical instruments and reconstruct high-fidelity surgical scenes. Through experiments on various surgical videos, our network outperforms existing method on many aspects, including rendering quality, rendering speed and GPU usage.

    "abstract": "Current personalized neural head avatars face a trade-off: lightweight models lack detail and realism, while high-quality, animatable avatars require significant computational resources, making them unsuitable for commodity devices. To address this gap, we introduce Gaussian Eigen Models (GEM), which provide high-quality, lightweight, and easily controllable head avatars. GEM utilizes 3D Gaussian primitives for representing the appearance combined with Gaussian splatting for rendering. Building on the success of mesh-based 3D morphable face models (3DMM), we define GEM as an ensemble of linear eigenbases for representing the head appearance of a specific subject. In particular, we construct linear bases to represent the position, scale, rotation, and opacity of the 3D Gaussians. This allows us to efficiently generate Gaussian primitives of a specific head shape by a linear combination of the basis vectors, only requiring a low-dimensional parameter vector that contains the respective coefficients. We propose to construct these linear bases (GEM) by distilling high-quality compute-intense CNN-based Gaussian avatar models that can generate expression-dependent appearance changes like wrinkles. These high-quality models are trained on multi-view videos of a subject and are distilled using a series of principal component analyses. Once we have obtained the bases that represent the animatable appearance space of a specific human, we learn a regressor that takes a single RGB image as input and predicts the low-dimensional parameter vector that corresponds to the shown facial expression. In a series of experiments, we compare GEM's self-reenactment and cross-person reenactment results to state-of-the-art 3D avatar methods, demonstrating GEM's higher visual quality and better generalization to new expressions.",

Prior works suffer from inconsistent 3D geometry or mediocre rendering quality due to improper representations. We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings by utilizing the recent state-of-the-art 3D explicit representation, Gaussian Splatting, and an unconditional diffusion model. This model learns to generate 3D objects represented by sets of GS ellipsoids. With these strong generative 3D priors, though learning unconditionally, the diffusion model is ready for view-guided reconstruction without further model fine-tuning. This is achieved by propagating fine-grained 2D features through the efficient yet flexible splatting function and the guided denoising sampling process. In addition, a 2D diffusion model is further employed to enhance rendering fidelity, and improve reconstructed GS quality by polishing and re-using the rendered images. The final reconstructed objects explicitly come with high-quality 3D structure and texture, and can be efficiently rendered in arbitrary views. Experiments on the challenging real-world CO3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Project page: https://yxmu.foo/GSD/",

In this work, we focus on investigating the expressiveness of human avatars when learned from monocular RGB video; a setting that introduces new challenges in capturing and animating fine-grained details. To this end, we introduce EVA, a drivable human model that meticulously sculpts fine details based on 3D Gaussians and SMPL-X, an expressive parametric human model. Focused on enhancing expressiveness, our work makes three key contributions. First, we highlight the critical importance of aligning the SMPL-X model with RGB frames for effective avatar learning. Recognizing the limitations of current SMPL-X prediction methods for in-the-wild videos, we introduce a plug-and-play module that significantly ameliorates misalignment issues. Second, we propose a context-aware adaptive density control strategy, which is adaptively adjusting the gradient thresholds to accommodate the varied granularity across body parts. Last but not least, we develop a feedback mechanism that predicts per-pixel confidence to better guide the learning of 3D Gaussians. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework both quantitatively and qualitatively, especially on the fine-grained hand and facial details.

Although these methods can successfully synthesize from views similar to training camera trajectory, directing the novel view outside the training camera distribution does not guarantee on-par performance. In this paper, we tackle the Extrapolated View Synthesis (EVS) problem by evaluating the reconstructions on views such as looking left, right or downwards with respect to training camera distributions. To improve rendering quality for EVS, we initialize our model by constructing dense LiDAR map, and propose to leverage prior scene knowledge such as surface normal estimator and large-scale diffusion model.

    "abstract": "Real-time 3D reconstruction of surgical scenes plays a vital role in computer-assisted surgery, holding a promise to enhance surgeons' visibility. Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown great potential for real-time novel view synthesis of general scenes, which relies on accurate poses and point clouds generated by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for initialization. However, 3DGS with SfM fails to recover accurate camera poses and geometry in surgical scenes due to the challenges of minimal textures and photometric inconsistencies. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose the first SfM-free 3DGS-based method for surgical scene reconstruction by jointly optimizing the camera poses and scene representation. Based on the video continuity, the key of our method is to exploit the immediate optical flow priors to guide the projection flow derived from 3D Gaussians. Unlike most previous methods relying on photometric loss only, we formulate the pose estimation problem as minimizing the flow loss between the projection flow and optical flow. A consistency check is further introduced to filter the flow outliers by detecting the rigid and reliable points that satisfy the epipolar geometry. During 3D Gaussian optimization, we randomly sample frames to optimize the scene representations to grow the 3D Gaussian progressively. Experiments on the SCARED dataset demonstrate our superior performance over existing methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation with high efficiency.

    "abstract": "The spatial distribution of the gaseous components of the Milky Way is of great importance for a number of different fields, e.g. Galactic structure, star formation and cosmic rays. However, obtaining distance information to gaseous clouds in the interstellar medium from Doppler-shifted line emission is notoriously difficult given our unique vantage point in the Galaxy. It requires precise knowledge of gas velocities and generally suffers from distance ambiguities.   Previous works often assumed the optically thin limit (no absorption), a fixed velocity field, and lack resolution overall. We aim to overcome these issues and improve previous reconstructions of the gaseous constituents of the interstellar medium of the Galaxy.   We use 3D Gaussian processes to model correlations in the interstellar medium, including correlations between different lines of sight, and enforce a spatially coherent structure in the prior. For modelling the transport of radiation from the emitting gas to us as observers, we take absorption effects into account. A special numerical grid ensures high resolution nearby. We infer the spatial distributions of HI, CO, their emission line-widths, and the Galactic velocity field in a joint Bayesian inference. We further constrain these fields with complementary data from Galactic masers and young stellar object clusters.   Our main result consists of a set of samples that implicitly contain statistical uncertainties. The resulting maps are spatially coherent and reproduce the data with high fidelity. We confirm previous findings regarding the warping and flaring of the Galactic disc. A comparison with 3D dust maps reveals a good agreement on scales larger than approximately 400 pc. While our results are not free of artefacts, they present a big step forward in obtaining high quality 3D maps of the interstellar medium.",

To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "3D building reconstruction from imaging data is an important task for many applications ranging from urban planning to reconnaissance. Modern Novel View synthesis (NVS) methods like NeRF and Gaussian Splatting offer powerful techniques for developing 3D models from natural 2D imagery in an unsupervised fashion. These algorithms generally require input training views surrounding the scene of interest, which, in the case of large buildings, is typically not available across all camera elevations. In particular, the most readily available camera viewpoints at scale across most buildings are at near-ground (e.g., with mobile phones) and aerial (drones) elevations. However, due to the significant difference in viewpoint between drone and ground image sets, camera registration - a necessary step for NVS algorithms - fails. In this work we propose a method, DRAGON, that can take drone and ground building imagery as input and produce a 3D NVS model. The key insight of DRAGON is that intermediate elevation imagery may be extrapolated by an NVS algorithm itself in an iterative procedure with perceptual regularization, thereby bridging the visual feature gap between the two elevations and enabling registration. We compiled a semi-synthetic dataset of 9 large building scenes using Google Earth Studio, and quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that DRAGON can generate compelling renderings on this dataset compared to baseline strategies.",

    "abstract": "Understanding 3D scenes is a crucial challenge in computer vision research with applications spanning multiple domains. Recent advancements in distilling 2D vision-language foundation models into neural fields, like NeRF and 3DGS, enable open-vocabulary segmentation of 3D scenes from 2D multi-view images without the need for precise 3D annotations. However, while effective, these methods typically rely on the per-pixel distillation of high-dimensional CLIP features, introducing ambiguity and necessitating complex regularization strategies, which adds inefficiency during training. This paper presents MaskField, which enables efficient 3D open-vocabulary segmentation with neural fields from a novel perspective. Unlike previous methods, MaskField decomposes the distillation of mask and semantic features from foundation models by formulating a mask feature field and queries. MaskField overcomes ambiguous object boundaries by naturally introducing SAM segmented object shapes without extra regularization during training. By circumventing the direct handling of dense high-dimensional CLIP features during training, MaskField is particularly compatible with explicit scene representations like 3DGS. Our extensive experiments show that MaskField not only surpasses prior state-of-the-art methods but also achieves remarkably fast convergence. We hope that MaskField will inspire further exploration into how neural fields can be trained to comprehend 3D scenes from 2D models.",

To this end, we introduce EgoGaussian, the first method capable of simultaneously reconstructing 3D scenes and dynamically tracking 3D object motion from RGB egocentric input alone. We leverage the uniquely discrete nature of Gaussian Splatting and segment dynamic interactions from the background, with both having explicit representations. Our approach employs a clip-level online learning pipeline that leverages the dynamic nature of human activities, allowing us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the scene in chronological order and track rigid object motion. EgoGaussian shows significant improvements in terms of both dynamic object and background reconstruction quality compared to the state-of-the-art. We also qualitatively demonstrate the high quality of the reconstructed models.",

    "abstract": "Recent approaches representing 3D objects and scenes using Gaussian splats show increased rendering speed across a variety of platforms and devices. While rendering such representations is indeed extremely efficient, storing and transmitting them is often prohibitively expensive. To represent large-scale scenes, one often needs to store millions of 3D Gaussians, occupying gigabytes of disk space. This poses a very practical limitation, prohibiting widespread adoption.Several solutions have been proposed to strike a balance between disk size and rendering quality, noticeably reducing the visual quality. In this work, we propose a new representation that dramatically reduces the hard drive footprint while featuring similar or improved quality when compared to the standard 3D Gaussian splats. When compared to other compact solutions, ours offers higher quality renderings with significantly reduced storage, being able to efficiently run on a mobile device in real-time. Our key observation is that nearby points in the scene can share similar representations. Hence, only a small ratio of 3D points needs to be stored. We introduce an approach to identify such points which are called parent points. The discarded points called children points along with attributes can be efficiently predicted by tiny MLPs.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian splatting has become a popular representation for novel-view synthesis, exhibiting clear strengths in efficiency, photometric quality, and compositional edibility. Following its success, many works have extended Gaussians to 4D, showing that dynamic Gaussians maintain these benefits while also tracking scene geometry far better than alternative representations. Yet, these methods assume dense multi-view videos as supervision. In this work, we are interested in extending the capability of Gaussian scene representations to casually captured monocular videos. We show that existing 4D Gaussian methods dramatically fail in this setup because the monocular setting is underconstrained. Building off this finding, we propose a method we call Dynamic Gaussian Marbles, which consist of three core modifications that target the difficulties of the monocular setting. First, we use isotropic Gaussian \"marbles'', reducing the degrees of freedom of each Gaussian. Second, we employ a hierarchical divide and-conquer learning strategy to efficiently guide the optimization towards solutions with globally coherent motion. Finally, we add image-level and geometry-level priors into the optimization, including a tracking loss that takes advantage of recent progress in point tracking. By constraining the optimization, Dynamic Gaussian Marbles learns Gaussian trajectories that enable novel-view rendering and accurately capture the 3D motion of the scene elements. We evaluate on the Nvidia Dynamic Scenes dataset and the DyCheck iPhone dataset, and show that Gaussian Marbles significantly outperforms other Gaussian baselines in quality, and is on-par with non-Gaussian representations, all while maintaining the efficiency, compositionality, editability, and tracking benefits of Gaussians.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is increasingly popular for 3D reconstruction due to its superior visual quality and rendering speed. However, 3DGS training currently occurs on a single GPU, limiting its ability to handle high-resolution and large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks due to memory constraints. We introduce Grendel, a distributed system designed to partition 3DGS parameters and parallelize computation across multiple GPUs. As each Gaussian affects a small, dynamic subset of rendered pixels, Grendel employs sparse all-to-all communication to transfer the necessary Gaussians to pixel partitions and performs dynamic load balancing. Unlike existing 3DGS systems that train using one camera view image at a time, Grendel supports batched training with multiple views. We explore various optimization hyperparameter scaling strategies and find that a simple sqrt(batch size) scaling rule is highly effective. Evaluations using large-scale, high-resolution scenes show that Grendel enhances rendering quality by scaling up 3DGS parameters across multiple GPUs. On the Rubble dataset, we achieve a test PSNR of 27.28 by distributing 40.4 million Gaussians across 16 GPUs, compared to a PSNR of 26.28 using 11.2 million Gaussians on a single GPU.

To transfer the high rendering quality to generation tasks, a series of research works attempt to generate 3D-Gaussian assets from text. However, the generated assets have not achieved the same quality as those in reconstruction tasks. We observe that Gaussians tend to grow without control as the generation process may cause indeterminacy. Aiming at highly enhancing the generation quality, we propose a novel framework named GaussianDreamerPro. The main idea is to bind Gaussians to reasonable geometry, which evolves over the whole generation process. Along different stages of our framework, both the geometry and appearance can be enriched progressively. The final output asset is constructed with 3D Gaussians bound to mesh, which shows significantly enhanced details and quality compared with previous methods. Notably, the generated asset can also be seamlessly integrated into downstream manipulation pipelines, e.g. animation, composition, and simulation etc., greatly promoting its potential in wide applications.

The latter holds a significant advantage by inherently easing rapid convergence during training and offering extensive editability. However, despite rapid advancements, the literature still lives in its infancy regarding the scalability of these models. In this study, we take some initial steps in addressing this gap, showing an approach that enables both the memory and computational scalability of such models. Specifically, we propose \"Trimming the fat\", a post-hoc gradient-informed iterative pruning technique to eliminate redundant information encoded in the model. Our experimental findings on widely acknowledged benchmarks attest to the effectiveness of our approach, revealing that up to 75% of the Gaussians can be removed while maintaining or even improving upon baseline performance. Our approach achieves around 50$\\times$ compression while preserving performance similar to the baseline model, and is able to speed-up computation up to 600 FPS.",

    "abstract": "The 3D Gaussian Splatting technique has significantly advanced the construction of radiance fields from multi-view images, enabling real-time rendering. While point-based rasterization effectively reduces computational demands for rendering, it often struggles to accurately reconstruct the geometry of the target object, especially under strong lighting. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach that combines octree-based implicit surface representations with Gaussian splatting. Our method consists of four stages. Initially, it reconstructs a signed distance field (SDF) and a radiance field through volume rendering, encoding them in a low-resolution octree. The initial SDF represents the coarse geometry of the target object. Subsequently, it introduces 3D Gaussians as additional degrees of freedom, which are guided by the SDF. In the third stage, the optimized Gaussians further improve the accuracy of the SDF, allowing it to recover finer geometric details compared to the initial SDF obtained in the first stage. Finally, it adopts the refined SDF to further optimize the 3D Gaussians via splatting, eliminating those that contribute little to visual appearance. Experimental results show that our method, which leverages the distribution of 3D Gaussians with SDFs, reconstructs more accurate geometry, particularly in images with specular highlights caused by strong lighting.",

We introduce Director3D, a robust open-world text-to-3D generation framework, designed to generate both real-world 3D scenes and adaptive camera trajectories. To achieve this, (1) we first utilize a Trajectory Diffusion Transformer, acting as the Cinematographer, to model the distribution of camera trajectories based on textual descriptions. (2) Next, a Gaussian-driven Multi-view Latent Diffusion Model serves as the Decorator, modeling the image sequence distribution given the camera trajectories and texts. This model, fine-tuned from a 2D diffusion model, directly generates pixel-aligned 3D Gaussians as an immediate 3D scene representation for consistent denoising. (3) Lastly, the 3D Gaussians are refined by a novel SDS++ loss as the Detailer, which incorporates the prior of the 2D diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Director3D outperforms existing methods, offering superior performance in real-world 3D generation.",

Our experiments support this claim by showing that tiny differences in evaluation protocols of various methods can lead to inconsistent reported metrics. To address these issues, we propose a framework called NerfBaselines, which simplifies the installation of various methods, provides consistent benchmarking tools, and ensures reproducibility.

We first analyze the reasons for this, identifying three main areas where storage can be reduced: the number of 3D Gaussian primitives used to represent a scene, the number of coefficients for the spherical harmonics used to represent directional radiance, and the precision required to store Gaussian primitive attributes. We present a solution to each of these issues. First, we propose an efficient, resolution-aware primitive pruning approach, reducing the primitive count by half. Second, we introduce an adaptive adjustment method to choose the number of coefficients used to represent directional radiance for each Gaussian primitive, and finally a codebook-based quantization method, together with a half-float representation for further memory reduction. Taken together, these three components result in a 27 reduction in overall size on disk on the standard datasets we tested, along with a 1.7 speedup in rendering speed. We demonstrate our method on standard datasets and show how our solution results in significantly reduced download times when using the method on a mobile device.",

Recent diffusion-based approaches via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) have enabled new possibilities but either intricately couple with human body or struggle to reuse. We introduce ClotheDreamer, a 3D Gaussian-based method for generating wearable, production-ready 3D garment assets from text prompts. We propose a novel representation Disentangled Clothe Gaussian Splatting (DCGS) to enable separate optimization. DCGS represents clothed avatar as one Gaussian model but freezes body Gaussian splats. To enhance quality and completeness, we incorporate bidirectional SDS to supervise clothed avatar and garment RGBD renderings respectively with pose conditions and propose a new pruning strategy for loose clothing. Our approach can also support custom clothing templates as input. Benefiting from our design, the synthetic 3D garment can be easily applied to virtual try-on and support physically accurate animation. Extensive experiments showcase our method's superior and competitive performance. Our project page is at https://ggxxii.github.io/clothedreamer.",

    "abstract": "The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) techniques and their dynamic scene modeling variants, 4D-GS, offers promising prospects for real-time rendering of dynamic surgical scenarios. However, the prerequisite for modeling dynamic scenes by a large number of Gaussian units, the high-dimensional Gaussian attributes and the high-resolution deformation fields, all lead to serve storage issues that hinder real-time rendering in resource-limited surgical equipment. To surmount these limitations, we introduce a Lightweight 4D Gaussian Splatting framework (LGS) that can liberate the efficiency bottlenecks of both rendering and storage for dynamic endoscopic reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the redundancy of Gaussian quantities, we propose Deformation-Aware Pruning by gauging the impact of each Gaussian on deformation. Concurrently, to reduce the redundancy of Gaussian attributes, we simplify the representation of textures and lighting in non-crucial areas by pruning the dimensions of Gaussian attributes. We further resolve the feature field redundancy caused by the high resolution of 4D neural spatiotemporal encoder for modeling dynamic scenes via a 4D feature field condensation. Experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate efficacy of LGS in terms of a compression rate exceeding 9 times while maintaining the pleasing visual quality and real-time rendering efficiency. LGS confirms a substantial step towards its application in robotic surgical services.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has transformed novel-view synthesis with its fast, interpretable, and high-fidelity rendering. However, its resource requirements limit its usability. Especially on constrained devices, training performance degrades quickly and often cannot complete due to excessive memory consumption of the model. The method converges with an indefinite number of Gaussians -- many of them redundant -- making rendering unnecessarily slow and preventing its usage in downstream tasks that expect fixed-size inputs. To address these issues, we tackle the challenges of training and rendering 3DGS models on a budget. We use a guided, purely constructive densification process that steers densification toward Gaussians that raise the reconstruction quality. Model size continuously increases in a controlled manner towards an exact budget, using score-based densification of Gaussians with training-time priors that measure their contribution. We further address training speed obstacles: following a careful analysis of 3DGS' original pipeline, we derive faster, numerically equivalent solutions for gradient computation and attribute updates, including an alternative parallelization for efficient backpropagation. We also propose quality-preserving approximations where suitable to reduce training time even further. Taken together, these enhancements yield a robust, scalable solution with reduced training times, lower compute and memory requirements, and high quality. Our evaluation shows that in a budgeted setting, we obtain competitive quality metrics with 3DGS while achieving a 4--5x reduction in both model size and training time. With more generous budgets, our measured quality surpasses theirs. These advances open the door for novel-view synthesis in constrained environments, e.g., mobile devices.",

Previous works neglect the inherent sparsity of 3D structure and do not utilize explicit geometric relationships between 3D and 2D images. This limits these methods to a low-resolution representation and makes it difficult to scale up to the dense views for better quality. GeoLRM tackles these issues by incorporating a novel 3D-aware transformer structure that directly processes 3D points and uses deformable cross-attention mechanisms to effectively integrate image features into 3D representations. We implement this solution through a two-stage pipeline: initially, a lightweight proposal network generates a sparse set of 3D anchor points from the posed image inputs; subsequently, a specialized reconstruction transformer refines the geometry and retrieves textural details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GeoLRM significantly outperforms existing models, especially for dense view inputs. We also demonstrate the practical applicability of our model with 3D generation tasks, showcasing its versatility and potential for broader adoption in real-world applications.

To this end, we first build a simulator by integrating Gaussian Splatting with quadrotor flight dynamics, and then, train robust navigation policies using Liquid neural networks. In this way, we obtain a full-stack imitation learning protocol that combines advances in 3D Gaussian splatting radiance field rendering, crafty programming of expert demonstration training data, and the task understanding capabilities of Liquid networks. Through a series of quantitative flight tests, we demonstrate the robust transfer of navigation skills learned in a single simulation scene directly to the real world. We further show the ability to maintain performance beyond the training environment under drastic distribution and physical environment changes.

We propose a new dynamic 3D Gaussian framework based on motion factorization to recover the object as 3D Gaussian point sets across different time states. Furthermore, we develop a coarse-to-fine filling strategy to generate the density fields of the object from the Gaussian reconstruction, allowing for the extraction of object continuums along with their surfaces and the integration of Gaussian attributes into these continuum. In addition to the extracted object surfaces, the Gaussian-informed continuum also enables the rendering of object masks during simulations, serving as 2D-shape guidance for physical property estimation.

However, current methods either struggle to model complex motions due to the absence of 3D structure or rely on implicit 3D representations that are ill-suited for manipulation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel explicit 3D representation-video Gaussian representation -- that embeds a video into 3D Gaussians. Our proposed representation models video appearance in a 3D canonical space using explicit Gaussians as proxies and associates each Gaussian with 3D motions for video motion. This approach offers a more intrinsic and explicit representation than layered atlas or volumetric pixel matrices. To obtain such a representation, we distill 2D priors, such as optical flow and depth, from foundation models to regularize learning in this ill-posed setting. Extensive applications demonstrate the versatility of our new video representation. It has been proven effective in numerous video processing tasks, including tracking, consistent video depth and feature refinement, motion and appearance editing, and stereoscopic video generation.

However, the resources needed for training and rendering inevitably limit the size of the captured scenes that can be represented with good visual quality. We introduce a hierarchy of 3D Gaussians that preserves visual quality for very large scenes, while offering an efficient Level-of-Detail (LOD) solution for efficient rendering of distant content with effective level selection and smooth transitions between levels.We introduce a divide-and-conquer approach that allows us to train very large scenes in independent chunks. We consolidate the chunks into a hierarchy that can be optimized to further improve visual quality of Gaussians merged into intermediate nodes. Very large captures typically have sparse coverage of the scene, presenting many challenges to the original 3D Gaussian splatting training method; we adapt and regularize training to account for these issues. We present a complete solution, that enables real-time rendering of very large scenes and can adapt to available resources thanks to our LOD method. We show results for captured scenes with up to tens of thousands of images with a simple and affordable rig, covering trajectories of up to several kilometers and lasting up to one hour.

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising technique capable of real-time rendering with high-quality 3D reconstruction. This method utilizes 3D Gaussian representation and tile-based splatting techniques, bypassing the expensive neural field querying. Despite its potential, 3DGS encounters challenges such as needle-like artifacts, suboptimal geometries, and inaccurate normals caused by the Gaussians converging into anisotropic shapes with one dominant variance. We propose using the effective rank analysis to examine the shape statistics of 3D Gaussian primitives, and identify the Gaussians indeed converge into needle-like shapes with the effective rank 1. To address this, we introduce the effective rank as a regularization, which constrains the structure of the Gaussians. Our new regularization method enhances normal and geometry reconstruction while reducing needle-like artifacts. The approach can be integrated as an add-on module to other 3DGS variants, improving their quality without compromising visual fidelity.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a cutting-edge technique for real-time radiance field rendering, offering state-of-the-art performance in terms of both quality and speed. 3DGS models a scene as a collection of three-dimensional Gaussians, or splats, with additional attributes optimized to conform to the scene's geometric and visual properties. Despite its advantages in rendering speed and image fidelity, 3DGS is limited by its significant storage and memory demands. These high demands make 3DGS impractical for mobile devices or headsets, reducing its applicability in important areas of computer graphics. To address these challenges and advance the practicality of 3DGS, this survey provides a comprehensive and detailed examination of compression and compaction techniques developed to make 3DGS more efficient. We categorize current approaches into compression techniques, which aim at achieving the highest quality at minimal data size, and compaction techniques, which aim for optimal quality with the fewest Gaussians. We introduce the basic mathematical concepts underlying the analyzed methods, as well as key implementation details and design choices. Our report thoroughly discusses similarities and differences among the methods, as well as their respective advantages and disadvantages. We establish a consistent standard for comparing these methods based on key performance metrics and datasets. Specifically, since these methods have been developed in parallel and over a short period of time, currently, no comprehensive comparison exists. This survey, for the first time, presents a unified standard to evaluate 3DGS compression techniques. To facilitate the continuous monitoring of emerging methodologies, we maintain a dedicated website that will be regularly updated with new techniques and revisions of existing findings https://w-m.github.io/3dgs-compression-survey/ .",

We propose a novel dual Gaussian-Particle representation that models the physical world while (i) enabling predictive simulation of future states and (ii) allowing online correction from visual observations in a dynamic world. Our representation comprises particles that capture the geometrical aspect of objects in the world and can be used alongside a particle-based physics system to anticipate physically plausible future states. Attached to these particles are 3D Gaussians that render images from any viewpoint through a splatting process thus capturing the visual state. By comparing the predicted and observed images, our approach generates visual forces that correct the particle positions while respecting known physical constraints. By integrating predictive physical modelling with continuous visually-derived corrections, our unified representation reasons about the present and future while synchronizing with reality. Our system runs in realtime at 30Hz using only 3 cameras. We validate our approach on 2D and 3D tracking tasks as well as photometric reconstruction quality.

    "abstract": "Photographs captured in unstructured tourist environments frequently exhibit variable appearances and transient occlusions, challenging accurate scene reconstruction and inducing artifacts in novel view synthesis. Although prior approaches have integrated the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) with additional learnable modules to handle the dynamic appearances and eliminate transient objects, their extensive training demands and slow rendering speeds limit practical deployments. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising alternative to NeRF, offering superior training and inference efficiency along with better rendering quality. This paper presents Wild-GS, an innovative adaptation of 3DGS optimized for unconstrained photo collections while preserving its efficiency benefits. Wild-GS determines the appearance of each 3D Gaussian by their inherent material attributes, global illumination and camera properties per image, and point-level local variance of reflectance. Unlike previous methods that model reference features in image space, Wild-GS explicitly aligns the pixel appearance features to the corresponding local Gaussians by sampling the triplane extracted from the reference image. This novel design effectively transfers the high-frequency detailed appearance of the reference view to 3D space and significantly expedites the training process. Furthermore, 2D visibility maps and depth regularization are leveraged to mitigate the transient effects and constrain the geometry, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Wild-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering performance and the highest efficiency in both training and inference among all the existing techniques.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in novel view synthesis have enabled real-time rendering speeds with high reconstruction accuracy. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), a foundational point-based parametric 3D scene representation, models scenes as large sets of 3D Gaussians. However, complex scenes can consist of millions of Gaussians, resulting in high storage and memory requirements that limit the viability of 3D-GS on devices with limited resources. Current techniques for compressing these pretrained models by pruning Gaussians rely on combining heuristics to determine which Gaussians to remove. At high compression ratios, these pruned scenes suffer from heavy degradation of visual fidelity and loss of foreground details. In this paper, we propose a principled sensitivity pruning score that preserves visual fidelity and foreground details at significantly higher compression ratios than existing approaches. It is computed as a second-order approximation of the reconstruction error on the training views with respect to the spatial parameters of each Gaussian. Additionally, we propose a multi-round prune-refine pipeline that can be applied to any pretrained 3D-GS model without changing its training pipeline. After pruning 90% of Gaussians, a substantially higher percentage than previous methods, our PUP 3D-GS pipeline increases average rendering speed by 3.56$\\times$ while retaining more salient foreground information and achieving higher image quality metrics than existing techniques on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.",

This dataset depicts 44K diverse objects with 110K animations rendered in 48 viewpoints, resulting in 12M videos with a total of 300M frames. We keep our L4GM simple for scalability and build directly on top of LGM, a pretrained 3D Large Reconstruction Model that outputs 3D Gaussian ellipsoids from multiview image input. L4GM outputs a per-frame 3D Gaussian Splatting representation from video frames sampled at a low fps and then upsamples the representation to a higher fps to achieve temporal smoothness. We add temporal self-attention layers to the base LGM to help it learn consistency across time, and utilize a per-timestep multiview rendering loss to train the model. The representation is upsampled to a higher framerate by training an interpolation model which produces intermediate 3D Gaussian representations. We showcase that L4GM that is only trained on synthetic data generalizes extremely well on in-the-wild videos, producing high quality animated 3D assets.",

    "abstract": "Achieving high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) from low-resolution input views is a challenging task due to the lack of high-resolution data. Previous methods optimize high-resolution Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) from low-resolution input views but suffer from slow rendering speed. In this work, we base our method on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) due to its capability of producing high-quality images at a faster rendering speed. To alleviate the shortage of data for higher-resolution synthesis, we propose to leverage off-the-shelf 2D diffusion priors by distilling the 2D knowledge into 3D with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). Nevertheless, applying SDS directly to Gaussian-based 3D super-resolution leads to undesirable and redundant 3D Gaussian primitives, due to the randomness brought by generative priors. To mitigate this issue, we introduce two simple yet effective techniques to reduce stochastic disturbances introduced by SDS. Specifically, we 1) shrink the range of diffusion timestep in SDS with an annealing strategy; 2) randomly discard redundant Gaussian primitives during densification. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed GaussainSR can attain high-quality results for HRNVS with only low-resolution inputs on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Traditional mesh-based representations are unsuitable for dense, fuzzy elements, and introduce additional complexity for filtering and differentiable rendering. Conversely, voxel-based representations struggle to model hard surfaces and suffer from intensive memory requirement. We propose a general-purpose rendering primitive based on 3D Gaussian distribution for unified scene representation, featuring versatile appearance ranging from glossy surfaces to fuzzy elements, as well as physically based scattering to enable accurate global illumination. We formulate the rendering theory for the primitive based on non-exponential transport and derive efficient rendering operations to be compatible with Monte Carlo path tracing. The new representation can be converted from different sources, including meshes and 3D Gaussian splatting, and further refined via transmittance optimization thanks to its differentiability. We demonstrate the versatility of our representation in various rendering applications such as global illumination and appearance editing, while supporting arbitrary lighting conditions by nature. Additionally, we compare our representation to existing volumetric representations, highlighting its efficiency to reproduce details.",

Our approach overcomes these constraints by leveraging the periodicity of ambient motions to learn the motion trajectory model, coupled with careful regularization. We also propose important practical strategies to improve the visual quality of the baseline 3DGS static reconstructions and to improve memory efficiency critical for GPU-memory intensive learning.

    "abstract": "Learning 3D head priors from large 2D image collections is an important step towards high-quality 3D-aware human modeling. A core requirement is an efficient architecture that scales well to large-scale datasets and large image resolutions. Unfortunately, existing 3D GANs struggle to scale to generate samples at high resolutions due to their relatively slow train and render speeds, and typically have to rely on 2D superresolution networks at the expense of global 3D consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Generative Gaussian Heads (GGHead), which adopts the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting representation within a 3D GAN framework. To generate a 3D representation, we employ a powerful 2D CNN generator to predict Gaussian attributes in the UV space of a template head mesh. This way, GGHead exploits the regularity of the template's UV layout, substantially facilitating the challenging task of predicting an unstructured set of 3D Gaussians. We further improve the geometric fidelity of the generated 3D representations with a novel total variation loss on rendered UV coordinates. Intuitively, this regularization encourages that neighboring rendered pixels should stem from neighboring Gaussians in the template's UV space. Taken together, our pipeline can efficiently generate 3D heads trained only from single-view 2D image observations. Our proposed framework matches the quality of existing 3D head GANs on FFHQ while being both substantially faster and fully 3D consistent. As a result, we demonstrate real-time generation and rendering of high-quality 3D-consistent heads at $1024^2$ resolution for the first time.

Existing methods have proposed NeRF-based implicit models to exploit visual cues as a condition for synthesizing binaural audio. However, in addition to low efficiency originating from heavy NeRF rendering, these methods all have a limited ability of characterizing the entire scene environment such as room geometry, material properties, and the spatial relation between the listener and sound source. To address these issues, we propose a novel Audio-Visual Gaussian Splatting (AV-GS) model. To obtain a material-aware and geometry-aware condition for audio synthesis, we learn an explicit point-based scene representation with an audio-guidance parameter on locally initialized Gaussian points, taking into account the space relation from the listener and sound source. To make the visual scene model audio adaptive, we propose a point densification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the Gaussian points, with the per-point contribution in sound propagation (e.g., more points needed for texture-less wall surfaces as they affect sound path diversion). Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our AV-GS over existing alternatives on the real-world RWAS and simulation-based SoundSpaces datasets.",

To address this challenge, we introduce the Gaussian-Forest modeling framework, which hierarchically represents a scene as a forest of hybrid 3D Gaussians.

Moreover, adaptive growth and pruning strategies are designed, ensuring detailed representation in complex regions and a notable reduction in the number of required Gaussians.

When it comes to editing of these objects, however, existing approaches are either slow, compromise on quality, or do not provide enough customization. We introduce a novel approach to quickly edit a 3D model from a single reference view. Our technique first segments the edit image, and then matches semantically corresponding regions across chosen segmented dataset views using DINO features. A color or texture change from a particular region of the edit image can then be applied to other views automatically in a semantically sensible manner. These edited views act as an updated dataset to further train and re-style the 3D scene. The end-result is therefore an edited 3D model. Our framework enables a wide variety of editing tasks such as manual local edits, correspondence based style transfer from any example image, and a combination of different styles from multiple example images. We use Gaussian Splats as our primary 3D representation due to their speed and ease of local editing, but our technique works for other methods such as NeRFs as well. We show through multiple examples that our method produces higher quality results while offering fine-grained control of editing. Project page: ice-gaussian.github.io",

    "abstract": "Creating realistic avatars from a single RGB image is an attractive yet challenging problem. Due to its ill-posed nature, recent works leverage powerful prior from 2D diffusion models pretrained on large datasets. Although 2D diffusion models demonstrate strong generalization capability, they cannot provide multi-view shape priors with guaranteed 3D consistency. We propose Human 3Diffusion: Realistic Avatar Creation via Explicit 3D Consistent Diffusion. Our key insight is that 2D multi-view diffusion and 3D reconstruction models provide complementary information for each other, and by coupling them in a tight manner, we can fully leverage the potential of both models. We introduce a novel image-conditioned generative 3D Gaussian Splats reconstruction model that leverages the priors from 2D multi-view diffusion models, and provides an explicit 3D representation, which further guides the 2D reverse sampling process to have better 3D consistency. Experiments show that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and enables the creation of realistic avatars from a single RGB image, achieving high-fidelity in both geometry and appearance. Extensive ablations also validate the efficacy of our design, (1) multi-view 2D priors conditioning in generative 3D reconstruction and (2) consistency refinement of sampling trajectory via the explicit 3D representation.

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis from raw images provides superior high dynamic range (HDR) information compared to reconstructions from low dynamic range RGB images. However, the inherent noise in unprocessed raw images compromises the accuracy of 3D scene representation. Our study reveals that 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is particularly susceptible to this noise, leading to numerous elongated Gaussian shapes that overfit the noise, thereby significantly degrading reconstruction quality and reducing inference speed, especially in scenarios with limited views. To address these issues, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework designed to reconstruct HDR 3DGS from a limited number of noisy raw images. This framework enhances 3DGS by integrating a noise extractor and employing a noise-robust reconstruction loss that leverages a noise distribution prior. Experimental results show that our method outperforms LDR/HDR 3DGS and previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised and supervised pre-trained models in both reconstruction quality and inference speed on the RawNeRF dataset across a broad range of training views.

Previous arts for geometry reconstruction from 3D Gaussians mainly focus on exploring strong geometry regularization. Instead, from a fresh perspective, we propose to obtain accurate 3D geometry of a scene by Gaussian trimming, which selectively removes the inaccurate geometry while preserving accurate structures. To achieve this, we analyze the contributions of individual 3D Gaussians and propose a contribution-based trimming strategy to remove the redundant or inaccurate Gaussians. Furthermore, our experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that a relatively small Gaussian scale is a non-negligible factor in representing and optimizing the intricate details. Therefore the proposed TrimGS maintains relatively small Gaussian scales. In addition, TrimGS is also compatible with the effective geometry regularization strategies in previous arts. When combined with the original 3DGS and the state-of-the-art 2DGS, TrimGS consistently yields more accurate geometry and higher perceptual quality. Our project page is https://trimgs.github.io",

However, these reconstructions often suffer from one or both of the following limitations: First, they typically represent scenes in low dynamic range (LDR), which restricts their use to evenly lit environments and hinders immersive viewing experiences. Secondly, their reliance on a pinhole camera model, assuming all scene elements are in focus in the input images, presents practical challenges and complicates refocusing during novel-view synthesis. Addressing these limitations, we present a lightweight method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes multi-view LDR images of a scene with varying exposure times, apertures, and focus distances as input to reconstruct a high-dynamic-range (HDR) radiance field. By incorporating analytical convolutions of Gaussians based on a thin-lens camera model as well as a tonemapping module, our reconstructions enable the rendering of HDR content with flexible refocusing capabilities. We demonstrate that our combined treatment of HDR and depth of field facilitates real-time cinematic rendering, outperforming the state of the art.",

    "abstract": "3D city generation with NeRF-based methods shows promising generation results but is computationally inefficient. Recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a highly efficient alternative for object-level 3D generation. However, adapting 3D-GS from finite-scale 3D objects and humans to infinite-scale 3D cities is non-trivial. Unbounded 3D city generation entails significant storage overhead (out-of-memory issues), arising from the need to expand points to billions, often demanding hundreds of Gigabytes of VRAM for a city scene spanning 10km^2. In this paper, we propose GaussianCity, a generative Gaussian Splatting framework dedicated to efficiently synthesizing unbounded 3D cities with a single feed-forward pass. Our key insights are two-fold: 1) Compact 3D Scene Representation: We introduce BEV-Point as a highly compact intermediate representation, ensuring that the growth in VRAM usage for unbounded scenes remains constant, thus enabling unbounded city generation. 2) Spatial-aware Gaussian Attribute Decoder: We present spatial-aware BEV-Point decoder to produce 3D Gaussian attributes, which leverages Point Serializer to integrate the structural and contextual characteristics of BEV points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaussianCity achieves state-of-the-art results in both drone-view and street-view 3D city generation. Notably, compared to CityDreamer, GaussianCity exhibits superior performance with a speedup of 60 times (10.72 FPS v.s. 0.18 FPS).",

However, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds, it is difficult to guarantee geometric reconstruction accuracy and multi-view consistency simply by relying on image reconstruction loss. Although many studies on surface reconstruction based on 3DGS have emerged recently, the quality of their meshes is generally unsatisfactory. To address this problem, we propose a fast planar-based Gaussian splatting reconstruction representation (PGSR) to achieve high-fidelity surface reconstruction while ensuring high-quality rendering. Specifically, we first introduce an unbiased depth rendering method, which directly renders the distance from the camera origin to the Gaussian plane and the corresponding normal map based on the Gaussian distribution of the point cloud, and divides the two to obtain the unbiased depth. We then introduce single-view geometric, multi-view photometric, and geometric regularization to preserve global geometric accuracy. We also propose a camera exposure compensation model to cope with scenes with large illumination variations. Experiments on indoor and outdoor scenes show that our method achieves fast training and rendering while maintaining high-fidelity rendering and geometric reconstruction, outperforming 3DGS-based and NeRF-based methods.",

Current works further leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting as 3D representation for improved visual quality and rendering efficiency. However, we observe that existing Gaussian reconstruction models often suffer from multi-view inconsistency and blurred textures. We attribute this to the compromise of multi-view information propagation in favor of adopting powerful yet computationally intensive architectures (e.g., Transformers). To address this issue, we introduce MVGamba, a general and lightweight Gaussian reconstruction model featuring a multi-view Gaussian reconstructor based on the RNN-like State Space Model (SSM). Our Gaussian reconstructor propagates causal context containing multi-view information for cross-view self-refinement while generating a long sequence of Gaussians for fine-detail modeling with linear complexity. With off-the-shelf multi-view diffusion models integrated, MVGamba unifies 3D generation tasks from a single image, sparse images, or text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVGamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in all 3D content generation scenarios with approximately only $0.1\\times$ of the model size.",

    "abstract": "Volumetric rendering based methods, like NeRF, excel in HDR view synthesis from RAWimages, especially for nighttime scenes. While, they suffer from long training times and cannot perform real-time rendering due to dense sampling requirements. The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering and faster training. However, implementing RAW image-based view synthesis directly using 3DGS is challenging due to its inherent drawbacks: 1) in nighttime scenes, extremely low SNR leads to poor structure-from-motion (SfM) estimation in distant views; 2) the limited representation capacity of spherical harmonics (SH) function is unsuitable for RAW linear color space; and 3) inaccurate scene structure hampers downstream tasks such as refocusing. To address these issues, we propose LE3D (Lighting Every darkness with 3DGS). Our method proposes Cone Scatter Initialization to enrich the estimation of SfM, and replaces SH with a Color MLP to represent the RAW linear color space. Additionally, we introduce depth distortion and near-far regularizations to improve the accuracy of scene structure for downstream tasks. These designs enable LE3D to perform real-time novel view synthesis, HDR rendering, refocusing, and tone-mapping changes. Compared to previous volumetric rendering based methods, LE3D reduces training time to 1% and improves rendering speed by up to 4,000 times for 2K resolution images in terms of FPS.

Despite recent advances in point cloud compression, decoding and rendering high-quality images from lossy compressed point clouds is still challenging in terms of quality and complexity, making it a major roadblock to achieve real-time 6-Degree-of-Freedom video streaming. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a point cloud compression scheme that generates a bit stream that can be directly decoded to renderable 3D Gaussians. The encoder and decoder are jointly optimized to consider both bit-rates and rendering quality. It significantly improves the rendering quality while substantially reducing decoding and rendering time, compared to existing point cloud compression methods. Furthermore, the proposed scheme generates a scalable bit stream, allowing multiple levels of details at different bit-rate ranges.

This makes it difficult to control the scene in ways that reflect the underlying dynamic structure, where the number of independent entities is typically much smaller. In particular, it can be challenging to animate and move objects in the scene, which requires coordination among many Gaussians. To address this issue, we develop a mutual information shaping technique that enforces movement resonance between correlated Gaussians in a motion network. Such correlations can be learned from putative 2D object masks in different views. By approximating the mutual information with the Jacobians of the motions, our method ensures consistent movements of the Gaussians composing different objects under various perturbations. In particular, we develop an efficient contrastive training pipeline with lightweight optimization to shape the motion network, avoiding the need for re-shaping throughout the motion sequence. Notably, our training only touches a small fraction of all Gaussians in the scene yet attains the desired compositional behavior according to the underlying dynamic structure. The proposed technique is evaluated on challenging scenes and demonstrates significant performance improvement in promoting consistent movements and 3D object segmentation while inducing low computation and memory requirements.",

For each object, we fit a small implicit neural network encoding spatially varying weights that act as a reduced deformation basis. These weights are trained to learn physically significant motions in the object via random perturbations. Our loss ensures we find a weight-space basis that best minimizes deformation energy by stochastically evaluating elastic energies through Monte Carlo sampling of the deformation volume. At runtime, we simulate in the reduced basis and sample the deformations back to the original domain.

Nevertheless, 3D-GS encounters the main challenge when it comes to accurately representing physical reflections, especially in the case of total reflection and semi-reflection that are commonly found in real-world scenes. This limitation causes reflections to be mistakenly treated as independent elements with physical presence, leading to imprecise reconstructions. Herein, to tackle this challenge, we propose RefGaussian to disentangle reflections from 3D-GS for realistically modeling reflections. Specifically, we propose to split a scene into transmitted and reflected components and represent these components using two Spherical Harmonics (SH). Given that this decomposition is not fully determined, we employ local regularization techniques to ensure local smoothness for both the transmitted and reflected components, thereby achieving more plausible decomposition outcomes than 3D-GS. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior novel view synthesis and accurate depth estimation outcomes. Furthermore, it enables the utilization of scene editing applications, ensuring both high-quality results and physical coherence.",

    "abstract": "Although 3D Gaussian Splatting has been widely studied because of its realistic and efficient novel-view synthesis, it is still challenging to extract a high-quality surface from the point-based representation. Previous works improve the surface by incorporating geometric priors from the off-the-shelf normal estimator. However, there are two main limitations: 1) Supervising normals rendered from 3D Gaussians effectively updates the rotation parameter but is less effective for other geometric parameters; 2) The inconsistency of predicted normal maps across multiple views may lead to severe reconstruction artifacts. In this paper, we propose a Depth-Normal regularizer that directly couples normal with other geometric parameters, leading to full updates of the geometric parameters from normal regularization. We further propose a confidence term to mitigate inconsistencies of normal predictions across multiple views. Moreover, we also introduce a densification and splitting strategy to regularize the size and distribution of 3D Gaussians for more accurate surface modeling. Compared with Gaussian-based baselines, experiments show that our approach obtains better reconstruction quality and maintains competitive appearance quality at faster training speed and 100+ FPS rendering.",

For generalisability, we start from a \"foundation\" model for monocular depth estimation and extend it to a full 3D shape and appearance reconstructor. For efficiency, we base this extension on feed-forward Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, we predict a first layer of 3D Gaussians at the predicted depth, and then add additional layers of Gaussians that are offset in space, allowing the model to complete the reconstruction behind occlusions and truncations. Flash3D is very efficient, trainable on a single GPU in a day, and thus accessible to most researchers. It achieves state-of-the-art results when trained and tested on RealEstate10k. When transferred to unseen datasets like NYU it outperforms competitors by a large margin. More impressively, when transferred to KITTI, Flash3D achieves better PSNR than methods trained specifically on that dataset. In some instances, it even outperforms recent methods that use multiple views as input. Code, models, demo, and more results are available at https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/flash3d/.",

However, current 3D generative models tend to focus only on surface features such as color and shape, neglecting the inherent physical properties that govern the behavior of objects in the real world. To accurately simulate physics-aligned dynamics, it is essential to predict the physical properties of materials and incorporate them into the behavior prediction process. Nonetheless, predicting the diverse materials of real-world objects is still challenging due to the complex nature of their physical attributes. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Physics3D}, a novel method for learning various physical properties of 3D objects through a video diffusion model. Our approach involves designing a highly generalizable physical simulation system based on a viscoelastic material model, which enables us to simulate a wide range of materials with high-fidelity capabilities. Moreover, we distill the physical priors from a video diffusion model that contains more understanding of realistic object materials. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both elastic and plastic materials. Physics3D shows great potential for bridging the gap between the physical world and virtual neural space, providing a better integration and application of realistic physical principles in virtual environments.

Over the past few years, a large body of work on creating 3D human avatars has been introduced, forming a new and abundant knowledge base for 3D human modeling. The scale of the literature makes it difficult for individuals to keep track of all the works. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these emerging techniques for 3D human avatar modeling, from both reconstruction and generation perspectives. Firstly, we review representative methods for 3D human reconstruction, including methods based on pixel-aligned implicit function, neural radiance field, and 3D Gaussian Splatting, etc. We then summarize representative methods for 3D human generation, especially those using large language models like CLIP, diffusion models, and various 3D representations, which demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Point management is a critical component in optimizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models, as the point initiation (e.g., via structure from motion) is distributionally inappropriate. Typically, the Adaptive Density Control (ADC) algorithm is applied, leveraging view-averaged gradient magnitude thresholding for point densification, opacity thresholding for pruning, and regular all-points opacity reset. However, we reveal that this strategy is limited in tackling intricate/special image regions (e.g., transparent) as it is unable to identify all the 3D zones that require point densification, and lacking an appropriate mechanism to handle the ill-conditioned points with negative impacts (occlusion due to false high opacity). To address these limitations, we propose a Localized Point Management (LPM) strategy, capable of identifying those error-contributing zones in the highest demand for both point addition and geometry calibration. Zone identification is achieved by leveraging the underlying multiview geometry constraints, with the guidance of image rendering errors. We apply point densification in the identified zone, whilst resetting the opacity of those points residing in front of these regions so that a new opportunity is created to correct ill-conditioned points. Serving as a versatile plugin, LPM can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D Gaussian Splatting models. Experimental evaluation across both static 3D and dynamic 4D scenes validate the efficacy of our LPM strategy in boosting a variety of existing 3DGS models both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, LPM improves both vanilla 3DGS and SpaceTimeGS to achieve state-of-the-art rendering quality while retaining real-time speeds, outperforming on challenging datasets such as Tanks & Temples and the Neural 3D Video Dataset.",

Current methods mainly utilize NeRF-based methods to represent the static scene and an additional time-variant MLP to model scene deformations, resulting in relatively low rendering quality as well as slow inference speed. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Superpoint Gaussian Splatting (SP-GS). Specifically, our framework first employs explicit 3D Gaussians to reconstruct the scene and then clusters Gaussians with similar properties (e.g., rotation, translation, and location) into superpoints. Empowered by these superpoints, our method manages to extend 3D Gaussian splatting to dynamic scenes with only a slight increase in computational expense. Apart from achieving state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering under high resolutions, the superpoint representation provides a stronger manipulation capability.

While classical iterative methods and deep learning approaches have achieved success in DIR, they are often hindered by computational inefficiency or poor generalization. In this paper, we introduce GaussianDIR, a novel, case-specific optimization DIR method inspired by 3D Gaussian splatting. In general, GaussianDIR represents image deformations using a sparse set of mobile and flexible Gaussian primitives, each defined by a center position, covariance, and local rigid transformation. This compact and explicit representation reduces noise and computational overhead while improving interpretability. Furthermore, the movement of individual voxel is derived via blending the local rigid transformation of the neighboring Gaussian primitives. By this, GaussianDIR captures both global smoothness and local rigidity as well as reduces the computational burden. To address varying levels of deformation complexity, GaussianDIR also integrates an adaptive density control mechanism that dynamically adjusts the density of Gaussian primitives. Additionally, we employ multi-scale Gaussian primitives to capture both coarse and fine deformations, reducing optimization to local minima. Experimental results on brain MRI, lung CT, and cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate that GaussianDIR outperforms existing DIR methods in both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its potential for clinical applications. Finally, as a training-free approach, it challenges the stereotype that iterative methods are inherently slow and transcend the limitations of poor generalization.",

However, these methods are limited to small-scale, homogeneous data, i.e. they cannot handle severe appearance and geometry variations due to weather, season, and lighting and do not scale to larger, dynamic areas with thousands of images.

We use 3D Gaussians as an efficient geometry scaffold while relying on neural fields as a compact and flexible appearance model. We integrate scene dynamics via a scene graph at global scale while modeling articulated motions on a local level via deformations. This decomposed approach enables flexible scene composition suitable for real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Most advances in 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (3D GANs) largely depend on ray casting-based volume rendering, which incurs demanding rendering costs. One promising alternative is rasterization-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), providing a much faster rendering speed and explicit 3D representation. In this paper, we exploit Gaussian as a 3D representation for 3D GANs by leveraging its efficient and explicit characteristics. However, in an adversarial framework, we observe that a na\\\"ive generator architecture suffers from training instability and lacks the capability to adjust the scale of Gaussians. This leads to model divergence and visual artifacts due to the absence of proper guidance for initialized positions of Gaussians and densification to manage their scales adaptively. To address these issues, we introduce a generator architecture with a hierarchical multi-scale Gaussian representation that effectively regularizes the position and scale of generated Gaussians. Specifically, we design a hierarchy of Gaussians where finer-level Gaussians are parameterized by their coarser-level counterparts; the position of finer-level Gaussians would be located near their coarser-level counterparts, and the scale would monotonically decrease as the level becomes finer, modeling both coarse and fine details of the 3D scene. Experimental results demonstrate that ours achieves a significantly faster rendering speed (x100) compared to state-of-the-art 3D consistent GANs with comparable 3D generation capability.

Among these, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a significant method, surpassing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). 3D-GS uses parameterized 3D Gaussians for modeling both spatial locations and color information, combined with a tile-based fast rendering technique.

To address this, we introduce Video-3DGS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based video refiner designed to enhance temporal consistency in zero-shot video editors. Our approach utilizes a two-stage 3D Gaussian optimizing process tailored for editing dynamic monocular videos. In the first stage, Video-3DGS employs an improved version of COLMAP, referred to as MC-COLMAP, which processes original videos using a Masked and Clipped approach. For each video clip, MC-COLMAP generates the point clouds for dynamic foreground objects and complex backgrounds. These point clouds are utilized to initialize two sets of 3D Gaussians (Frg-3DGS and Bkg-3DGS) aiming to represent foreground and background views. Both foreground and background views are then merged with a 2D learnable parameter map to reconstruct full views. In the second stage, we leverage the reconstruction ability developed in the first stage to impose the temporal constraints on the video diffusion model. To demonstrate the efficacy of Video-3DGS on both stages, we conduct extensive experiments across two related tasks: Video Reconstruction and Video Editing. Video-3DGS trained with 3k iterations significantly improves video reconstruction quality (+3 PSNR, +7 PSNR increase) and training efficiency (x1.9, x4.5 times faster) over NeRF-based and 3DGS-based state-of-art methods on DAVIS dataset, respectively.

While analytical DRR renderers offer greater efficiency, they overlook anisotropic X-ray image formation phenomena, such as Compton scattering. We present a novel approach that marries realistic physics-inspired X-ray simulation with efficient, differentiable DRR generation using 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). Our direction-disentangled 3DGS (DDGS) method separates the radiosity contribution into isotropic and direction-dependent components, approximating complex anisotropic interactions without intricate runtime simulations. Additionally, we adapt the 3DGS initialization to account for tomography data properties, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in image accuracy. Furthermore, our DDGS shows promise for intraoperative applications and inverse problems such as pose registration, delivering superior registration accuracy and runtime performance compared to analytical DRR methods.",

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown promise for photorealistic and real-time NVS of static scenes. Building on 3DGS, we propose an efficient point-based differentiable rendering framework for scene reconstruction from photo collections. Our key innovation is a residual-based spherical harmonic coefficients transfer module that adapts 3DGS to varying lighting conditions and photometric post-processing. This lightweight module can be pre-computed and ensures efficient gradient propagation from rendered images to 3D Gaussian attributes. Additionally, we observe that the appearance encoder and the transient mask predictor, the two most critical parts of NVS from unconstrained photo collections, can be mutually beneficial. We introduce a plug-and-play lightweight spatial attention module to simultaneously predict transient occluders and latent appearance representation for each image. After training and preprocessing, our method aligns with the standard 3DGS format and rendering pipeline, facilitating seamlessly integration into various 3DGS applications.

    "abstract": "Latent scene representation plays a significant role in training reinforcement learning (RL) agents. To obtain good latent vectors describing the scenes, recent works incorporate the 3D-aware latent-conditioned NeRF pipeline into scene representation learning. However, these NeRF-related methods struggle to perceive 3D structural information due to the inefficient dense sampling in volumetric rendering. Moreover, they lack fine-grained semantic information included in their scene representation vectors because they evenly consider free and occupied spaces. Both of them can destroy the performance of downstream RL tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel framework that adopts the efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to learn 3D scene representation for the first time. In brief, we present the Query-based Generalizable 3DGS to bridge the 3DGS technique and scene representations with more geometrical awareness than those in NeRFs. Moreover, we present the Hierarchical Semantics Encoding to ground the fine-grained semantic features to 3D Gaussians and further distilled to the scene representation vectors. We conduct extensive experiments on two RL platforms including Maniskill2 and Robomimic across 10 different tasks. The results show that our method outperforms the other 5 baselines by a large margin. We achieve the best success rates on 8 tasks and the second-best on the other two tasks.",

Our primary motivation stems from observing that existing 3DGS-based open vocabulary methods mainly focus on 2D pixel-level parsing. These methods struggle with 3D point-level tasks due to weak feature expressiveness and inaccurate 2D-3D feature associations. To ensure robust feature presentation and 3D point-level understanding, we first employ SAM masks without cross-frame associations to train instance features with 3D consistency. These features exhibit both intra-object consistency and inter-object distinction. Then, we propose a two-stage codebook to discretize these features from coarse to fine levels. At the coarse level, we consider the positional information of 3D points to achieve location-based clustering, which is then refined at the fine level. Finally, we introduce an instance-level 3D-2D feature association method that links 3D points to 2D masks, which are further associated with 2D CLIP features. Extensive experiments, including open vocabulary-based 3D object selection, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object selection, and ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

In this work, we present FastLGS, an approach that supports real-time open-vocabulary query within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under high resolution. We propose the semantic feature grid to save multi-view CLIP features which are extracted based on Segment Anything Model (SAM) masks, and map the grids to low dimensional features for semantic field training through 3DGS. Once trained, we can restore pixel-aligned CLIP embeddings through feature grids from rendered features for open-vocabulary queries. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods prove that FastLGS can achieve the first place performance concerning both speed and accuracy, where FastLGS is 98x faster than LERF and 4x faster than LangSplat. Meanwhile, experiments show that FastLGS is adaptive and compatible with many downstream tasks, such as 3D segmentation and 3D object inpainting, which can be easily applied to other 3D manipulation systems.",

    "abstract": "3D reconstruction and simulation, although interrelated, have distinct objectives: reconstruction requires a flexible 3D representation that can adapt to diverse scenes, while simulation needs a structured representation to model motion principles effectively. This paper introduces the Mesh-adsorbed Gaussian Splatting (MaGS) method to address this challenge. MaGS constrains 3D Gaussians to roam near the mesh, creating a mutually adsorbed mesh-Gaussian 3D representation. Such representation harnesses both the rendering flexibility of 3D Gaussians and the structured property of meshes. To achieve this, we introduce RMD-Net, a network that learns motion priors from video data to refine mesh deformations, alongside RGD-Net, which models the relative displacement between the mesh and Gaussians to enhance rendering fidelity under mesh constraints. To generalize to novel, user-defined deformations beyond input video without reliance on temporal data, we propose MPE-Net, which leverages inherent mesh information to bootstrap RMD-Net and RGD-Net. Due to the universality of meshes, MaGS is compatible with various deformation priors such as ARAP, SMPL, and soft physics simulation. Extensive experiments on the D-NeRF, DG-Mesh, and PeopleSnapshot datasets demonstrate that MaGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction and simulation.",

    "abstract": "3D representation is essential to the significant advance of 3D generation with 2D diffusion priors. As a flexible representation, NeRF has been first adopted for 3D representation. With density-based volumetric rendering, it however suffers both intensive computational overhead and inaccurate mesh extraction. Using a signed distance field and Marching Tetrahedra, DMTet allows for precise mesh extraction and real-time rendering but is limited in handling large topological changes in meshes, leading to optimization challenges. Alternatively, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is favored in both training and rendering efficiency while falling short in mesh extraction. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D representation, Tetrahedron Splatting (TeT-Splatting), that supports easy convergence during optimization, precise mesh extraction, and real-time rendering simultaneously. This is achieved by integrating surface-based volumetric rendering within a structured tetrahedral grid while preserving the desired ability of precise mesh extraction, and a tile-based differentiable tetrahedron rasterizer. Furthermore, we incorporate eikonal and normal consistency regularization terms for the signed distance field to improve generation quality and stability. Critically, our representation can be trained without mesh extraction, making the optimization process easier to converge. Our TeT-Splatting can be readily integrated in existing 3D generation pipelines, along with polygonal mesh for texture optimization. Extensive experiments show that our TeT-Splatting strikes a superior tradeoff among convergence speed, render efficiency, and mesh quality as compared to previous alternatives under varying 3D generation settings.",

However, its potential for reconstructing detailed 3D shapes has not been fully explored. Existing methods often suffer from limited shape accuracy due to the discrete and unstructured nature of Gaussian splats, which complicates the shape extraction. While recent techniques like 2D GS have attempted to improve shape reconstruction, they often reformulate the Gaussian primitives in ways that reduce both rendering quality and computational efficiency. To address these problems, our work introduces a rasterized approach to render the depth maps and surface normal maps of general 3D Gaussian splats. Our method not only significantly enhances shape reconstruction accuracy but also maintains the computational efficiency intrinsic to Gaussian Splatting. It achieves a Chamfer distance error comparable to NeuraLangelo on the DTU dataset and maintains similar computational efficiency as the original 3D GS methods. Our method is a significant advancement in Gaussian Splatting and can be directly integrated into existing Gaussian Splatting-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting (GS) has significantly elevated scene reconstruction efficiency and novel view synthesis (NVS) accuracy compared to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), particularly for dynamic scenes. However, current 4D NVS methods, whether based on GS or NeRF, primarily rely on camera parameters provided by COLMAP and even utilize sparse point clouds generated by COLMAP for initialization, which lack accuracy as well are time-consuming. This sometimes results in poor dynamic scene representation, especially in scenes with large object movements, or extreme camera conditions e.g. small translations combined with large rotations. Some studies simultaneously optimize the estimation of camera parameters and scenes, supervised by additional information like depth, optical flow, etc. obtained from off-the-shelf models. Using this unverified information as ground truth can reduce robustness and accuracy, which does frequently occur for long monocular videos (with e.g. > hundreds of frames). We propose a novel approach that learns a high-fidelity 4D GS scene representation with self-calibration of camera parameters. It includes the extraction of 2D point features that robustly represent 3D structure, and their use for subsequent joint optimization of camera parameters and 3D structure towards overall 4D scene optimization. We demonstrate the accuracy and time efficiency of our method through extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results on several standard benchmarks.

Afterward, we perform alternative geometry and texture optimization frame-by-frame for high-quality geometry and texture learning while maintaining temporal topology stability. Finally, we can extract dynamic facial meshes in regular wiring arrangement and high-fidelity textures with pore-level details from the learned Gaussians.

The fundamental idea is to view the rendering tasks under various lighting positions as a multi-task learning problem, which our meta-learning approach effectively addresses by generalizing the learned Gaussian geometries not only across different viewpoints but also across diverse light positions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of training efficiency and rendering quality compared to existing methods for free-viewpoint relighting.",

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a promising framework for novel view synthesis, offering fast rendering speeds and high fidelity. However, the large number of Gaussians and their associated attributes require effective compression techniques. Existing methods primarily compress neural Gaussians individually and independently, i.e., coding all the neural Gaussians at the same time, with little design for their interactions and spatial dependence. Inspired by the effectiveness of the context model in image compression, we propose the first autoregressive model at the anchor level for 3DGS compression in this work. We divide anchors into different levels and the anchors that are not coded yet can be predicted based on the already coded ones in all the coarser levels, leading to more accurate modeling and higher coding efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of entropy coding, e.g., to code the coarsest level with no already coded anchors, we propose to introduce a low-dimensional quantized feature as the hyperprior for each anchor, which can be effectively compressed. Our work pioneers the context model in the anchor level for 3DGS representation, yielding an impressive size reduction of over 100 times compared to vanilla 3DGS and 15 times compared to the most recent state-of-the-art work Scaffold-GS, while achieving comparable or even higher rendering quality.",

This paper introduces R$^2$-Gaussian, the first 3DGS-based framework for sparse-view tomographic reconstruction. By carefully deriving X-ray rasterization functions, we discover a previously unknown integration bias in the standard 3DGS formulation, which hampers accurate volume retrieval. To address this issue, we propose a novel rectification technique via refactoring the projection from 3D to 2D Gaussians. Our new method presents three key innovations: (1) introducing tailored Gaussian kernels, (2) extending rasterization to X-ray imaging, and (3) developing a CUDA-based differentiable voxelizer. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy and efficiency.

Given its under-constrained nature, we attempt to leverage 3D geometric priors from a novel view diffusion model and 2D appearance priors from an image generation model to guide the optimization process. We note that there is a disparity between the generation priors of these two diffusion models, leading to their different appearance outputs. Specifically, image generation models tend to deliver more detailed visuals, whereas novel view models produce consistent yet over-smooth results across different views. Directly combining them leads to suboptimal effects due to their appearance conflicts. Hence, we propose a 2D-3D hybrid Fourier Score Distillation objective function, hy-FSD. It optimizes 3D Gaussians using 3D priors in spatial domain to ensure geometric consistency, while exploiting 2D priors in the frequency domain through Fourier transform for better visual quality. hy-FSD can be integrated into existing 3D generation methods and produce significant performance gains. With this technique, we further develop an image-to-3D generation pipeline to create high-quality 3D objects within one minute, named Fourier123.

Despite the efficacy of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for driving scenes, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerges as a promising direction due to its faster speed and more explicit representation. However, most existing street 3DGS methods require tracked 3D vehicle bounding boxes to decompose the static and dynamic elements for effective reconstruction, limiting their applications for in-the-wild scenarios.

    "abstract": "Learning 3D scene representation from a single-view image is a long-standing fundamental problem in computer vision, with the inherent ambiguity in predicting contents unseen from the input view. Built on the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), the Splatter Image method has made promising progress on fast single-image novel view synthesis via learning a single 3D Gaussian for each pixel based on the U-Net feature map of an input image. However, it has limited expressive power to represent occluded components that are not observable in the input view. To address this problem, this paper presents a Hierarchical Splatter Image method in which a pixel is worth more than one 3D Gaussians. Specifically, each pixel is represented by a parent 3D Gaussian and a small number of child 3D Gaussians. Parent 3D Gaussians are learned as done in the vanilla Splatter Image. Child 3D Gaussians are learned via a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) which takes as input the projected image features of a parent 3D Gaussian and the embedding of a target camera view. Both parent and child 3D Gaussians are learned end-to-end in a stage-wise way. The joint condition of input image features from eyes of the parent Gaussians and the target camera position facilitates learning to allocate child Gaussians to ``see the unseen'', recovering the occluded details that are often missed by parent Gaussians.   In experiments, the proposed method is tested on the ShapeNet-SRN and CO3D datasets with state-of-the-art performance obtained, especially showing promising capabilities of reconstructing occluded contents in the input view.",

Estimating the structure and motion of unknown objects in dynamic environments is fundamental for such autonomous systems. Traditionally, the solutions have relied on prior knowledge of target objects, multiple disparate representations, or low-fidelity outputs unsuitable for robotic operations. This work proposes a novel approach to incrementally reconstruct and track a dynamic unknown object using a unified representation -- a set of 3D Gaussian blobs that describe its geometry and appearance. The differentiable 3D Gaussian Splatting framework is adapted to a dynamic object-centric setting. The input to the pipeline is a sequential set of RGB-D images. 3D reconstruction and 6-DoF pose tracking tasks are tackled using first-order gradient-based optimization. The formulation is simple, requires no pre-training, assumes no prior knowledge of the object or its motion, and is suitable for online applications. The proposed approach is validated on a dataset of 10 unknown spacecraft of diverse geometry and texture under arbitrary relative motion. The experiments demonstrate successful 3D reconstruction and accurate 6-DoF tracking of the target object in proximity operations over a short to medium duration. The causes of tracking drift are discussed and potential solutions are outlined.",

In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{P}ixel-\\textbf{L}evel \\textbf{A}lignment for text-driven \\textbf{4D} Gaussian splatting (PLA4D) to resolve this motion-geometry conflict. PLA4D provides an anchor reference, i.e., text-generated video, to align the rendering process conditioned by different DMs in pixel space. For static alignment, our approach introduces a focal alignment method and Gaussian-Mesh contrastive learning to iteratively adjust focal lengths and provide explicit geometric priors at each timestep. At the dynamic level, a motion alignment technique and T-MV refinement method are employed to enforce both pose alignment and motion continuity across unknown viewpoints, ensuring intrinsic geometric consistency across views. With such pixel-level multi-DM alignment, our PLA4D framework is able to generate 4D objects with superior geometric, motion, and semantic consistency. Fully implemented with open-source tools, PLA4D offers an efficient and accessible solution for high-quality 4D digital content creation with significantly reduced generation time.",

GaussianPrediction can forecast future states from any viewpoint, using video observations of dynamic scenes. To this end, we first propose a 3D Gaussian canonical space with deformation modeling to capture the appearance and geometry of dynamic scenes, and integrate the lifecycle property into Gaussians for irreversible deformations. To make the prediction feasible and efficient, a concentric motion distillation approach is developed by distilling the scene motion with key points.

Inspired by the continuity of signed distance field (SDF), which naturally has advantages in modeling surfaces, we present a unified optimizing framework integrating neural SDF with 3DGS. This framework incorporates a learnable neural SDF field to guide the densification and pruning of Gaussians, enabling Gaussians to accurately model scenes even with poor initialized point clouds. At the same time, the geometry represented by Gaussians improves the efficiency of the SDF field by piloting its point sampling.

To address the challenge of sparse input views, previous approaches have incorporated depth supervision into the training of 3D Gaussians to mitigate overfitting, using dense predictions from pretrained depth networks as pseudo-ground truth. Nevertheless, depth predictions from monocular depth estimation models inherently exhibit significant uncertainty in specific areas. Relying solely on pixel-wise L2 loss may inadvertently incorporate detrimental noise from these uncertain areas. In this work, we introduce a novel method to supervise the depth distribution of 3D Gaussians, utilizing depth priors with integrated uncertainty estimates. To address these localized errors in depth predictions, we integrate a patch-wise optimal transport strategy to complement traditional L2 loss in depth supervision.

    "abstract": "The limited robustness of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to motion blur and camera noise, along with its poor real-time performance, restricts its application in robotic SLAM tasks. Upon analysis, the primary causes of these issues are the density of views with motion blur and the cumulative errors in dense pose estimation from calculating losses based on noisy original images and rendering results, which increase the difficulty of 3DGS rendering convergence. Thus, a cutting-edge 3DGS-based SLAM system is introduced, leveraging the efficiency and flexibility of 3DGS to achieve real-time performance while remaining robust against sensor noise, motion blur, and the challenges posed by long-session SLAM. Central to this approach is the Fusion Bridge module, which seamlessly integrates tracking-centered ORB Visual Odometry with mapping-centered online 3DGS. Precise pose initialization is enabled by this module through joint optimization of re-projection and rendering loss, as well as strategic view selection, enhancing rendering convergence in large-scale scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art rendering quality and localization accuracy, positioning this system as a promising solution for real-world robotics applications that require stable, near-real-time performance.

Constructing such avatars is a challenging research problem, due to a high demand for photo-realism and real-time rendering performance. In this work, we propose Neural Parametric Gaussian Avatars (NPGA), a data-driven approach to create high-fidelity, controllable avatars from multi-view video recordings. We build our method around 3D Gaussian splatting for its highly efficient rendering and to inherit the topological flexibility of point clouds. In contrast to previous work, we condition our avatars' dynamics on the rich expression space of neural parametric head models (NPHM), instead of mesh-based 3DMMs. To this end, we distill the backward deformation field of our underlying NPHM into forward deformations which are compatible with rasterization-based rendering. All remaining fine-scale, expression-dependent details are learned from the multi-view videos. For increased representational capacity of our avatars, we propose per-Gaussian latent features that condition each primitives dynamic behavior. To regularize this increased dynamic expressivity, we propose Laplacian terms on the latent features and predicted dynamics. We evaluate our method on the public NeRSemble dataset, demonstrating that NPGA significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art avatars on the self-reenactment task by 2.6 PSNR. Furthermore, we demonstrate accurate animation capabilities from real-world monocular videos.",

    "abstract": "We tackle the task of learning dynamic 3D semantic radiance fields given a single monocular video as input. Our learned semantic radiance field captures per-point semantics as well as color and geometric properties for a dynamic 3D scene, enabling the generation of novel views and their corresponding semantics. This enables the segmentation and tracking of a diverse set of 3D semantic entities, specified using a simple and intuitive interface that includes a user click or a text prompt. To this end, we present DGD, a unified 3D representation for both the appearance and semantics of a dynamic 3D scene, building upon the recently proposed dynamic 3D Gaussians representation. Our representation is optimized over time with both color and semantic information. Key to our method is the joint optimization of the appearance and semantic attributes, which jointly affect the geometric properties of the scene. We evaluate our approach in its ability to enable dense semantic 3D object tracking and demonstrate high-quality results that are fast to render, for a diverse set of scenes.

    "abstract": "This paper aims to introduce 3D Gaussian for efficient, expressive, and editable digital avatar generation. This task faces two major challenges: (1) The unstructured nature of 3D Gaussian makes it incompatible with current generation pipelines; (2) the expressive animation of 3D Gaussian in a generative setting that involves training with multiple subjects remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel avatar generation method named $E^3$Gen, to effectively address these challenges. First, we propose a novel generative UV features plane representation that encodes unstructured 3D Gaussian onto a structured 2D UV space defined by the SMPL-X parametric model. This novel representation not only preserves the representation ability of the original 3D Gaussian but also introduces a shared structure among subjects to enable generative learning of the diffusion model. To tackle the second challenge, we propose a part-aware deformation module to achieve robust and accurate full-body expressive pose control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in avatar generation and enables expressive full-body pose control and editing.

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the mainstream methodologies for novel view synthesis (NVS) due to its high quality and fast rendering speed. However, as a point-based scene representation, 3DGS potentially generates a large number of Gaussians to fit the scene, leading to high memory usage. Improvements that have been proposed require either an empirical and preset pruning ratio or importance score threshold to prune the point cloud. Such hyperparamter requires multiple rounds of training to optimize and achieve the maximum pruning ratio, while maintaining the rendering quality for each scene. In this work, we propose learning-to-prune 3DGS (LP-3DGS), where a trainable binary mask is applied to the importance score that can find optimal pruning ratio automatically. Instead of using the traditional straight-through estimator (STE) method to approximate the binary mask gradient, we redesign the masking function to leverage the Gumbel-Sigmoid method, making it differentiable and compatible with the existing training process of 3DGS. Extensive experiments have shown that LP-3DGS consistently produces a good balance that is both efficient and high quality.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, its training heavily depends on high-quality, sharp images and accurate camera poses. Fulfilling these requirements can be challenging in non-ideal real-world scenarios, where motion-blurred images are commonly encountered in high-speed moving cameras or low-light environments that require long exposure times. To address these challenges, we introduce Event Stream Assisted Gaussian Splatting (EvaGaussians), a novel approach that integrates event streams captured by an event camera to assist in reconstructing high-quality 3D-GS from blurry images. Capitalizing on the high temporal resolution and dynamic range offered by the event camera, we leverage the event streams to explicitly model the formation process of motion-blurred images and guide the deblurring reconstruction of 3D-GS. By jointly optimizing the 3D-GS parameters and recovering camera motion trajectories during the exposure time, our method can robustly facilitate the acquisition of high-fidelity novel views with intricate texture details. We comprehensively evaluated our method and compared it with previous state-of-the-art deblurring rendering methods. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our method surpasses existing techniques in restoring fine details from blurry images and producing high-fidelity novel views.",

    "abstract": "Recovering 4D world from monocular video is a crucial yet challenging task. Conventional methods usually rely on the assumptions of multi-view videos, known camera parameters, or static scenes. In this paper, we relax all these constraints and tackle a highly ambitious but practical task: With only one monocular video without camera parameters, we aim to recover the dynamic 3D world alongside the camera poses. To solve this, we introduce GFlow, a new framework that utilizes only 2D priors (depth and optical flow) to lift a video to a 4D scene, as a flow of 3D Gaussians through space and time. GFlow starts by segmenting the video into still and moving parts, then alternates between optimizing camera poses and the dynamics of the 3D Gaussian points. This method ensures consistency among adjacent points and smooth transitions between frames. Since dynamic scenes always continually introduce new visual content, we present prior-driven initialization and pixel-wise densification strategy for Gaussian points to integrate new content. By combining all those techniques, GFlow transcends the boundaries of 4D recovery from causal videos; it naturally enables tracking of points and segmentation of moving objects across frames. Additionally, GFlow estimates the camera poses for each frame, enabling novel view synthesis by changing camera pose. This capability facilitates extensive scene-level or object-level editing, highlighting GFlow's versatility and effectiveness. Visit our project page at: https://littlepure2333.github.io/GFlow",

    "abstract": "Unveiling an empty street from crowded observations captured by in-car cameras is crucial for autonomous driving. However, removing all temporarily static objects, such as stopped vehicles and standing pedestrians, presents a significant challenge. Unlike object-centric 3D inpainting, which relies on thorough observation in a small scene, street scene cases involve long trajectories that differ from previous 3D inpainting tasks. The camera-centric moving environment of captured videos further complicates the task due to the limited degree and time duration of object observation. To address these obstacles, we introduce StreetUnveiler to reconstruct an empty street. StreetUnveiler learns a 3D representation of the empty street from crowded observations. Our representation is based on the hard-label semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) for its scalability and ability to identify Gaussians to be removed. We inpaint rendered image after removing unwanted Gaussians to provide pseudo-labels and subsequently re-optimize the 2DGS. Given its temporal continuous movement, we divide the empty street scene into observed, partial-observed, and unobserved regions, which we propose to locate through a rendered alpha map. This decomposition helps us to minimize the regions that need to be inpainted. To enhance the temporal consistency of the inpainting, we introduce a novel time-reversal framework to inpaint frames in reverse order and use later frames as references for earlier frames to fully utilize the long-trajectory observations. Our experiments conducted on the street scene dataset successfully reconstructed a 3D representation of the empty street. The mesh representation of the empty street can be extracted for further applications. The project page and more visualizations can be found at: https://streetunveiler.github.io",

    "abstract": "One of the key advantages of 3D rendering is its ability to simulate intricate scenes accurately. One of the most widely used methods for this purpose is Gaussian Splatting, a novel approach that is known for its rapid training and inference capabilities. In essence, Gaussian Splatting involves incorporating data about the 3D objects of interest into a series of Gaussian distributions, each of which can then be depicted in 3D in a manner analogous to traditional meshes. It is regrettable that the use of Gaussians in Gaussian Splatting is currently somewhat restrictive due to their perceived linear nature. In practice, 3D objects are often composed of complex curves and highly nonlinear structures. This issue can to some extent be alleviated by employing a multitude of Gaussian components to reflect the complex, nonlinear structures accurately. However, this approach results in a considerable increase in time complexity. This paper introduces the concept of negative Gaussians, which are interpreted as items with negative colors. The rationale behind this approach is based on the density distribution created by dividing the probability density functions (PDFs) of two Gaussians, which we refer to as Diff-Gaussian. Such a distribution can be used to approximate structures such as donut and moon-shaped datasets. Experimental findings indicate that the application of these techniques enhances the modeling of high-frequency elements with rapid color transitions. Additionally, it improves the representation of shadows. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to extend the simple elipsoid shapes of Gaussian Splatting to more complex nonlinear structures.",

Compared to implicit neural representations as another continuous spatial representation with increasing attention, our method with flexible 3D Gaussians presents enhanced accuracy on vorticity preservation. Moreover, we apply physics-driven strategies to accelerate the optimization-based time integration of Gaussian functions. This temporal evolution surpasses previous work based on implicit neural representation with reduced computational time and memory.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the increasing demand for dynamic 3D assets in design and gaming applications has given rise to powerful generative pipelines capable of synthesizing high-quality 4D objects. Previous methods generally rely on score distillation sampling (SDS) algorithm to infer the unseen views and motion of 4D objects, thus leading to unsatisfactory results with defects like over-saturation and Janus problem. Therefore, inspired by recent progress of video diffusion models, we propose to optimize a 4D representation by explicitly generating multi-view videos from one input image. However, it is far from trivial to handle practical challenges faced by such a pipeline, including dramatic temporal inconsistency, inter-frame geometry and texture diversity, and semantic defects brought by video generation results. To address these issues, we propose DG4D, a novel multi-stage framework that generates high-quality and consistent 4D assets without score distillation. Specifically, collaborative techniques and solutions are developed, including an attention injection strategy to synthesize temporal-consistent multi-view videos, a robust and efficient dynamic reconstruction method based on Gaussian Splatting, and a refinement stage with diffusion prior for semantic restoration. The qualitative results and user preference study demonstrate that our framework outperforms the baselines in generation quality by a considerable margin.

Subsequently, we present the Pixel-wise Triplet Fusion to eliminate redundancy of 3D Gaussians in overlapping view regions and to aggregate features observed across multiple views. Additionally, we propose a simple but effective free-view training strategy that ensures robust view synthesis across broader view range regardless of the number of views. Our empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art novel view synthesis peformances in both novel view rendered color maps quality and depth maps accuracy across different numbers of input views. We also show that FreeSplat performs inference more efficiently and can effectively reduce redundant Gaussians, offering the possibility of feed-forward large scene reconstruction without depth priors.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has revolutionized three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction with its implicit representation. Building upon NeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has departed from the implicit representation of neural networks and instead directly represents scenes as point clouds with Gaussian-shaped distributions. While this shift has notably elevated the rendering quality and speed of radiance fields but inevitably led to a significant increase in memory usage. Additionally, effectively rendering dynamic scenes in 3D-GS has emerged as a pressing challenge. To address these concerns, this paper purposes a refined 3D Gaussian representation for high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction. Firstly, we use a deformable multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to capture the dynamic offset of Gaussian points and express the color features of points through hash encoding and a tiny MLP to reduce storage requirements. Subsequently, we introduce a learnable denoising mask coupled with denoising loss to eliminate noise points from the scene, thereby further compressing 3D Gaussian model. Finally, motion noise of points is mitigated through static constraints and motion consistency constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in rendering quality and speed, while significantly reducing the memory usage associated with 3D-GS, making it highly suitable for various tasks such as novel view synthesis, and dynamic mapping.",

    "abstract": "Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery benefits from enhancing dynamic scene reconstruction, as it improves surgical outcomes. While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been effective in scene reconstruction, their slow inference speeds and lengthy training durations limit their applicability. To overcome these limitations, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based methods have emerged as a recent trend, offering rapid inference capabilities and superior 3D quality. However, these methods still struggle with under-reconstruction in both static and dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose HFGS, a novel approach for deformable endoscopic reconstruction that addresses these challenges from spatial and temporal frequency perspectives. Our approach incorporates deformation fields to better handle dynamic scenes and introduces Spatial High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (SHF) to minimize discrepancies in spatial frequency spectra between the rendered image and its ground truth. Additionally, we introduce Temporal High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (THF) to enhance dynamic awareness in neural rendering by leveraging flow priors, focusing optimization on motion-intensive parts. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that HFGS achieves superior rendering quality.",

Despite yielding high reconstruction quality, existing methods suffer from slow rendering speeds and long training times, limiting their intraoperative applicability. Motivated by recent progress in 3D Gaussian Splatting, an emerging technology in real-time 3D rendering, this work presents a novel fast reconstruction framework, termed Deform3DGS, for deformable tissues during endoscopic surgery. Specifically, we introduce 3D GS into surgical scenes by integrating a point cloud initialization to improve reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a novel flexible deformation modeling scheme (FDM) to learn tissue deformation dynamics at the level of individual Gaussians. Our FDM can model the surface deformation with efficient representations, allowing for real-time rendering performance. More importantly, FDM significantly accelerates surgical scene reconstruction, demonstrating considerable clinical values, particularly in intraoperative settings where time efficiency is crucial. Experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos indicate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing superior reconstruction fidelity PSNR: (37.90) and rendering speed (338.8 FPS) while substantially reducing training time to only 1 minute/scene.

Previous works have attempted to address this issue by deforming a NeRF in canonical space or manipulating the radiance field based on an explicit mesh. However, manipulating NeRF is not highly controllable and requires a long training and inference time. With the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), extremely high-fidelity novel view synthesis can be achieved using an explicit point-based 3D representation with much faster training and rendering speed. However, there is still a lack of effective means to manipulate 3DGS freely while maintaining rendering quality. In this work, we aim to tackle the challenge of achieving manipulable photo-realistic rendering. We propose to utilize a triangular mesh to manipulate 3DGS directly with self-adaptation. This approach reduces the need to design various algorithms for different types of Gaussian manipulation. By utilizing a triangle shape-aware Gaussian binding and adapting method, we can achieve 3DGS manipulation and preserve high-fidelity rendering after manipulation. Our approach is capable of handling large deformations, local manipulations, and soft body simulations while keeping high-quality rendering. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is also effective with inaccurate meshes extracted from 3DGS.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made significant strides in novel view synthesis. However, its suboptimal densification process results in the excessively large number of Gaussian primitives, which impacts frame-per-second and increases memory usage, making it unsuitable for low-end devices. To address this issue, many follow-up studies have proposed various pruning techniques with score functions designed to identify and remove less important primitives. Nonetheless, a comprehensive discussion of their effectiveness and implications across all techniques is missing. In this paper, we are the first to categorize 3DGS pruning techniques into two types: Scene-level pruning and Pixel-level pruning, distinguished by their scope for ranking primitives. Our subsequent experiments reveal that, while scene-level pruning leads to disastrous quality drops under extreme decimation of Gaussian primitives, pixel-level pruning not only sustains relatively high rendering quality with minuscule performance degradation but also provides an inherent boundary of pruning, i.e., a safeguard of Gaussian pruning. Building on this observation, we further propose multiple variations of score functions based on the factors of rendering equations and discover that assessing based on color similarity with blending weight is the most effective method for discriminating insignificant primitives. In our experiments, our SafeguardGS with the optimal score function shows the highest PSNR-per-primitive performance under an extreme pruning setting, retaining only about 10% of the primitives from the original 3DGS scene (i.e., 10x compression ratio). We believe our research provides valuable insights for optimizing 3DGS for future works.",

Dash cam videos often suffer from severe obstructions such as reflections and occlusions on the windshields, which significantly impede the application of neural rendering techniques. To address this challenge, we develop DC-Gaussian based on the recent real-time neural rendering technique 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach includes an adaptive image decomposition module to model reflections and occlusions in a unified manner. Additionally, we introduce illumination-aware obstruction modeling to manage reflections and occlusions under varying lighting conditions. Lastly, we employ a geometry-guided Gaussian enhancement strategy to improve rendering details by incorporating additional geometry priors.

To this end, we introduce GOI, a framework that integrates semantic features from 2D vision-language foundation models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and identifies 3D Gaussians of Interest using an Optimizable Semantic-space Hyperplane. Our approach includes an efficient compression method that utilizes scene priors to condense noisy high-dimensional semantic features into compact low-dimensional vectors, which are subsequently embedded in 3DGS. During the open-vocabulary querying process, we adopt a distinct approach compared to existing methods, which depend on a manually set fixed empirical threshold to select regions based on their semantic feature distance to the query text embedding. This traditional approach often lacks universal accuracy, leading to challenges in precisely identifying specific target areas. Instead, our method treats the feature selection process as a hyperplane division within the feature space, retaining only those features that are highly relevant to the query. We leverage off-the-shelf 2D Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) models to fine-tune the semantic-space hyperplane, enabling a more precise distinction between target regions and others. This fine-tuning substantially improves the accuracy of open-vocabulary queries, ensuring the precise localization of pertinent 3D Gaussians.

Most existing methods employ dense grids such as voxels as scene representations, which ignore the sparsity of occupancy and the diversity of object scales and thus lead to unbalanced allocation of resources. To address this, we propose an object-centric representation to describe 3D scenes with sparse 3D semantic Gaussians where each Gaussian represents a flexible region of interest and its semantic features. We aggregate information from images through the attention mechanism and iteratively refine the properties of 3D Gaussians including position, covariance, and semantics.

We conduct extensive experiments on the widely adopted nuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting-based techniques have recently advanced 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, achieving high-quality real-time rendering. However, these approaches are inherently limited by the underlying pinhole camera assumption in modeling the images and hence only work for All-in-Focus (AiF) sharp image inputs. This severely affects their applicability in real-world scenarios where images often exhibit defocus blur due to the limited depth-of-field (DOF) of imaging devices. Additionally, existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods also do not support rendering of DOF effects.   To address these challenges, we introduce DOF-GS that allows for rendering adjustable DOF effects, removing defocus blur as well as refocusing of 3D scenes, all from multi-view images degraded by defocus blur. To this end, we re-imagine the traditional Gaussian Splatting pipeline by employing a finite aperture camera model coupled with explicit, differentiable defocus rendering guided by the Circle-of-Confusion (CoC). The proposed framework provides for dynamic adjustment of DOF effects by changing the aperture and focal distance of the underlying camera model on-demand. It also enables rendering varying DOF effects of 3D scenes post-optimization, and generating AiF images from defocused training images. Furthermore, we devise a joint optimization strategy to further enhance details in the reconstructed scenes by jointly optimizing rendered defocused and AiF images. Our experimental results indicate that DOF-GS produces high-quality sharp all-in-focus renderings conditioned on inputs compromised by defocus blur, with the training process incurring only a modest increase in GPU memory consumption. We further demonstrate the applications of the proposed method for adjustable defocus rendering and refocusing of the 3D scene from input images degraded by defocus blur.",

This selective retention is crucial for robotic perception, localization, and mapping. To endow robots with this capability, we introduce 3D Gaussian Mapping (3DGM), a self-supervised, camera-only offline mapping framework grounded in 3D Gaussian Splatting. 3DGM converts multitraverse RGB videos from the same region into a Gaussian-based environmental map while concurrently performing 2D ephemeral object segmentation. Our key observation is that the environment remains consistent across traversals, while objects frequently change. This allows us to exploit self-supervision from repeated traversals to achieve environment-object decomposition. More specifically, 3DGM formulates multitraverse environmental mapping as a robust differentiable rendering problem, treating pixels of the environment and objects as inliers and outliers, respectively. Using robust feature distillation, feature residuals mining, and robust optimization, 3DGM jointly performs 2D segmentation and 3D mapping without human intervention. We build the Mapverse benchmark, sourced from the Ithaca365 and nuPlan datasets, to evaluate our method in unsupervised 2D segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and neural rendering.

Despite its advancements, the high computational costs of NeRF have posed challenges for its deployment in resource-constrained environments and real-time applications. As an alternative to NeRF-like neural rendering methods, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers rapid rendering speeds while maintaining excellent image quality. However, as it represents objects and scenes using a myriad of Gaussians, it requires substantial storage to achieve high-quality representation. To mitigate the storage overhead, we propose Factorized 3D Gaussian Splatting (F-3DGS), a novel approach that drastically reduces storage requirements while preserving image quality. Inspired by classical matrix and tensor factorization techniques, our method represents and approximates dense clusters of Gaussians with significantly fewer Gaussians through efficient factorization. We aim to efficiently represent dense 3D Gaussians by approximating them with a limited amount of information for each axis and their combinations. This method allows us to encode a substantially large number of Gaussians along with their essential attributes -- such as color, scale, and rotation -- necessary for rendering using a relatively small number of elements. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that F-3DGS achieves a significant reduction in storage costs while maintaining comparable quality in rendered images.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of Gaussian Splats, recent efforts have focused on large-scale scene geometric reconstruction. However, most of these efforts either concentrate on memory reduction or spatial space division, neglecting information in the semantic space. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named SA-GS, for fine-grained 3D geometry reconstruction using semantic-aware 3D Gaussian Splats. Specifically, we leverage prior information stored in large vision models such as SAM and DINO to generate semantic masks. We then introduce a geometric complexity measurement function to serve as soft regularization, guiding the shape of each Gaussian Splat within specific semantic areas. Additionally, we present a method that estimates the expected number of Gaussian Splats in different semantic areas, effectively providing a lower bound for Gaussian Splats in these areas. Subsequently, we extract the point cloud using a novel probability density-based extraction method, transforming Gaussian Splats into a point cloud crucial for downstream tasks. Our method also offers the potential for detailed semantic inquiries while maintaining high image-based reconstruction results.

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce a novel approach for creating controllable dynamics in 3D-generated Gaussians using casually captured reference videos. Our method transfers the motion of objects from reference videos to a variety of generated 3D Gaussians across different categories, ensuring precise and customizable motion transfer. We achieve this by employing blend skinning-based non-parametric shape reconstruction to extract the shape and motion of reference objects. This process involves segmenting the reference objects into motion-related parts based on skinning weights and establishing shape correspondences with generated target shapes. To address shape and temporal inconsistencies prevalent in existing methods, we integrate physical simulation, driving the target shapes with matched motion. This integration is optimized through a displacement loss to ensure reliable and genuine dynamics. Our approach supports diverse reference inputs, including humans, quadrupeds, and articulated objects, and can generate dynamics of arbitrary length, providing enhanced fidelity and applicability. Unlike methods heavily reliant on diffusion video generation models, our technique offers specific and high-quality motion transfer, maintaining both shape integrity and temporal consistency.",

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in synthesizing photorealistic images of large-scale scenes. However, they are often plagued by a loss of fine details and long rendering durations. 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently been introduced as a potent alternative, achieving both high-fidelity visual results and accelerated rendering performance. Nonetheless, scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting is fraught with challenges. Specifically, large-scale scenes grapples with the integration of objects across multiple scales and disparate viewpoints, which often leads to compromised efficacy as the Gaussians need to balance between detail levels. Furthermore, the generation of initialization points via COLMAP from large-scale dataset is both computationally demanding and prone to incomplete reconstructions. To address these challenges, we present Pyramidal 3D Gaussian Splatting (PyGS) with NeRF Initialization. Our approach represent the scene with a hierarchical assembly of Gaussians arranged in a pyramidal fashion. The top level of the pyramid is composed of a few large Gaussians, while each subsequent layer accommodates a denser collection of smaller Gaussians. We effectively initialize these pyramidal Gaussians through sampling a rapidly trained grid-based NeRF at various frequencies. We group these pyramidal Gaussians into clusters and use a compact weighting network to dynamically determine the influence of each pyramid level of each cluster considering camera viewpoint during rendering. Our method achieves a significant performance leap across multiple large-scale datasets and attains a rendering time that is over 400 times faster than current state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "The availability of large-scale multimodal datasets and advancements in diffusion models have significantly accelerated progress in 4D content generation. Most prior approaches rely on multiple image or video diffusion models, utilizing score distillation sampling for optimization or generating pseudo novel views for direct supervision. However, these methods are hindered by slow optimization speeds and multi-view inconsistency issues. Spatial and temporal consistency in 4D geometry has been extensively explored respectively in 3D-aware diffusion models and traditional monocular video diffusion models. Building on this foundation, we propose a strategy to migrate the temporal consistency in video diffusion models to the spatial-temporal consistency required for 4D generation. Specifically, we present a novel framework, \\textbf{Diffusion4D}, for efficient and scalable 4D content generation. Leveraging a meticulously curated dynamic 3D dataset, we develop a 4D-aware video diffusion model capable of synthesizing orbital views of dynamic 3D assets. To control the dynamic strength of these assets, we introduce a 3D-to-4D motion magnitude metric as guidance. Additionally, we propose a novel motion magnitude reconstruction loss and 3D-aware classifier-free guidance to refine the learning and generation of motion dynamics. After obtaining orbital views of the 4D asset, we perform explicit 4D construction with Gaussian splatting in a coarse-to-fine manner. The synthesized multi-view consistent 4D image set enables us to swiftly generate high-fidelity and diverse 4D assets within just several minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generation efficiency and 4D geometry consistency across various prompt modalities.",

However, existing methods show significantly worse reconstruction quality than competing methods using other 3D representations, e.g. neural points clouds, since they either do not employ global map and pose optimization or make use of monocular depth. In response, we propose the first RGB-only SLAM system with a dense 3D Gaussian map representation that utilizes all benefits of globally optimized tracking by adapting dynamically to keyframe pose and depth updates by actively deforming the 3D Gaussian map. Moreover, we find that refining the depth updates in inaccurate areas with a monocular depth estimator further improves the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction. Our experiments on the Replica, TUM-RGBD, and ScanNet datasets indicate the effectiveness of globally optimized 3D Gaussians, as the approach achieves superior or on par performance with existing RGB-only SLAM methods methods in tracking, mapping and rendering accuracy while yielding small map sizes and fast runtimes.

    "abstract": "We aim to tackle sparse-view reconstruction of a 360 3D scene using priors from latent diffusion models (LDM). The sparse-view setting is ill-posed and underconstrained, especially for scenes where the camera rotates 360 degrees around a point, as no visual information is available beyond some frontal views focused on the central object(s) of interest. In this work, we show that pretrained 2D diffusion models can strongly improve the reconstruction of a scene with low-cost fine-tuning. Specifically, we present SparseSplat360 (Sp2360), a method that employs a cascade of in-painting and artifact removal models to fill in missing details and clean novel views. Due to superior training and rendering speeds, we use an explicit scene representation in the form of 3D Gaussians over NeRF-based implicit representations. We propose an iterative update strategy to fuse generated pseudo novel views with existing 3D Gaussians fitted to the initial sparse inputs. As a result, we obtain a multi-view consistent scene representation with details coherent with the observed inputs. Our evaluation on the challenging Mip-NeRF360 dataset shows that our proposed 2D to 3D distillation algorithm considerably improves the performance of a regularized version of 3DGS adapted to a sparse-view setting and outperforms existing sparse-view reconstruction methods in 360 scene reconstruction. Qualitatively, our method generates entire 360 scenes from as few as 9 input views, with a high degree of foreground and background detail.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a very promising scene representation, achieving state-of-the-art quality in novel view synthesis significantly faster than competing alternatives. However, its use of spherical harmonics to represent scene colors limits the expressivity of 3D Gaussians and, as a consequence, the capability of the representation to generalize as we move away from the training views. In this paper, we propose to encode the color information of 3D Gaussians into per-Gaussian feature vectors, which we denote as Feature Splatting (FeatSplat). To synthesize a novel view, Gaussians are first \"splatted\" into the image plane, then the corresponding feature vectors are alpha-blended, and finally the blended vector is decoded by a small MLP to render the RGB pixel values. To further inform the model, we concatenate a camera embedding to the blended feature vector, to condition the decoding also on the viewpoint information. Our experiments show that these novel model for encoding the radiance considerably improves novel view synthesis for low overlap views that are distant from the training views. Finally, we also show the capacity and convenience of our feature vector representation, demonstrating its capability not only to generate RGB values for novel views, but also their per-pixel semantic labels.

We introduce closed-form solutions for transmittance and free-flight distance sampling for different kernels, and propose several optimizations to use our method efficiently within any off-the-shelf volumetric path tracer. We demonstrate our method as a compact and efficient alternative to other forms of volume modeling for forward and inverse rendering of scattering media. Furthermore, we adapt and showcase our method in radiance field optimization and rendering, providing additional flexibility compared to current state of the art given its ray-tracing formulation. We also introduce the Epanechnikov kernel and demonstrate its potential as an efficient alternative to the traditionally-used Gaussian kernel in scene reconstruction tasks. The versatility and physically-based nature of our approach allows us to go beyond radiance fields and bring to kernel-based modeling and rendering any path-tracing enabled functionality such as scattering, relighting and complex camera models.",

The rendered HDR images capture a wider range of brightness levels containing more details of the scene than normal low dynamic range (LDR) images. Existing HDR NVS methods are mainly based on NeRF. They suffer from long training time and slow inference speed. In this paper, we propose a new framework, High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting (HDR-GS), which can efficiently render novel HDR views and reconstruct LDR images with a user input exposure time. Specifically, we design a Dual Dynamic Range (DDR) Gaussian point cloud model that uses spherical harmonics to fit HDR color and employs an MLP-based tone-mapper to render LDR color. The HDR and LDR colors are then fed into two Parallel Differentiable Rasterization (PDR) processes to reconstruct HDR and LDR views. To establish the data foundation for the research of 3D Gaussian splatting-based methods in HDR NVS, we recalibrate the camera parameters and compute the initial positions for Gaussian point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that our HDR-GS surpasses the state-of-the-art NeRF-based method by 3.84 and 1.91 dB on LDR and HDR NVS while enjoying 1000x inference speed and only requiring 6.3% training time.

Given that training a 3DGS requires a significant amount of time and computational cost, it is crucial to protect the copyright, integrity, and privacy of such 3D assets. Steganography, as a crucial technique for encrypted transmission and copyright protection, has been extensively studied. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. Unlike its predecessor NeRF, 3DGS possesses two distinct features: 1) explicit 3D representation; and 2) real-time rendering speeds. These characteristics result in the 3DGS point cloud files being public and transparent, with each Gaussian point having a clear physical significance. Therefore, ensuring the security and fidelity of the original 3D scene while embedding information into the 3DGS point cloud files is an extremely challenging task. To solve the above-mentioned issue, we first propose a steganography framework for 3DGS, dubbed GS-Hider, which can embed 3D scenes and images into original GS point clouds in an invisible manner and accurately extract the hidden messages. Specifically, we design a coupled secured feature attribute to replace the original 3DGS's spherical harmonics coefficients and then use a scene decoder and a message decoder to disentangle the original RGB scene and the hidden message. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed GS-Hider can effectively conceal multimodal messages without compromising rendering quality and possesses exceptional security, robustness, capacity, and flexibility.

This framework includes a depth estimation module, an intensity reconstruction module, and a Gaussian regression module.

To facilitate related studies, we build a novel event-based 3D dataset with various material objects and calibrated labels of grayscale images, depth maps, camera poses, and silhouettes. Experiments show models that have jointly trained significantly outperform those trained individually.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a low-budget and high-authenticity bidirectional telepresence system, Tele-Aloha, targeting peer-to-peer communication scenarios. Compared to previous systems, Tele-Aloha utilizes only four sparse RGB cameras, one consumer-grade GPU, and one autostereoscopic screen to achieve high-resolution (2048x2048), real-time (30 fps), low-latency (less than 150ms) and robust distant communication. As the core of Tele-Aloha, we propose an efficient novel view synthesis algorithm for upper-body. Firstly, we design a cascaded disparity estimator for obtaining a robust geometry cue. Additionally a neural rasterizer via Gaussian Splatting is introduced to project latent features onto target view and to decode them into a reduced resolution. Further, given the high-quality captured data, we leverage weighted blending mechanism to refine the decoded image into the final resolution of 2K. Exploiting world-leading autostereoscopic display and low-latency iris tracking, users are able to experience a strong three-dimensional sense even without any wearable head-mounted display device. Altogether, our telepresence system demonstrates the sense of co-presence in real-life experiments, inspiring the next generation of communication.",

We firstly utilize a multi-view diffusion model to generate sparse multi-view inputs from single images or text prompts, and then a transformer-based model is trained to predict a tensorial SDF field from these sparse multi-view image inputs.

In this paper, we introduce MagicDrive3D, a novel pipeline for controllable 3D street scene generation that supports multi-condition control, including BEV maps, 3D objects, and text descriptions. Unlike previous methods that reconstruct before training the generative models, MagicDrive3D first trains a video generation model and then reconstructs from the generated data. This innovative approach enables easily controllable generation and static scene acquisition, resulting in high-quality scene reconstruction. To address the minor errors in generated content, we propose deformable Gaussian splatting with monocular depth initialization and appearance modeling to manage exposure discrepancies across viewpoints.

    "abstract": "Editing objects within a scene is a critical functionality required across a broad spectrum of applications in computer vision and graphics. As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerges as a frontier in scene representation, the effective modification of 3D Gaussian scenes has become increasingly vital. This process entails accurately retrieve the target objects and subsequently performing modifications based on instructions. Though available in pieces, existing techniques mainly embed sparse semantics into Gaussians for retrieval, and rely on an iterative dataset update paradigm for editing, leading to over-smoothing or inconsistency issues. To this end, this paper proposes a systematic approach, namely TIGER, for coherent text-instructed 3D Gaussian retrieval and editing. In contrast to the top-down language grounding approach for 3D Gaussians, we adopt a bottom-up language aggregation strategy to generate a denser language embedded 3D Gaussians that supports open-vocabulary retrieval. To overcome the over-smoothing and inconsistency issues in editing, we propose a Coherent Score Distillation (CSD) that aggregates a 2D image editing diffusion model and a multi-view diffusion model for score distillation, producing multi-view consistent editing with much finer details. In various experiments, we demonstrate that our TIGER is able to accomplish more consistent and realistic edits than prior work.",

Recently, mesh-based road surface reconstruction algorithms have shown promising reconstruction results. However, these mesh-based methods suffer from slow speed and poor reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose a novel large-scale road surface reconstruction approach with meshgrid Gaussian, named RoGs. Specifically, we model the road surface by placing Gaussian surfels in the vertices of a uniformly distributed square mesh, where each surfel stores color, semantic, and geometric information. This square mesh-based layout covers the entire road with fewer Gaussian surfels and reduces the overlap between Gaussian surfels during training. In addition, because the road surface has no thickness, 2D Gaussian surfel is more consistent with the physical reality of the road surface than 3D Gaussian sphere. Then, unlike previous initialization methods that rely on point clouds, we introduce a vehicle pose-based initialization method to initialize the height and rotation of the Gaussian surfel. Thanks to this meshgrid Gaussian modeling and pose-based initialization, our method achieves significant speedups while improving reconstruction quality. We obtain excellent results in reconstruction of road surfaces in a variety of challenging real-world scenes.",

    "abstract": "Over the past years, we have observed an abundance of approaches for modeling dynamic 3D scenes using Gaussian Splatting (GS). Such solutions use GS to represent the scene's structure and the neural network to model dynamics. Such approaches allow fast rendering and extracting each element of such a dynamic scene. However, modifying such objects over time is challenging. SC-GS (Sparse Controlled Gaussian Splatting) enhanced with Deformed Control Points partially solves this issue. However, this approach necessitates selecting elements that need to be kept fixed, as well as centroids that should be adjusted throughout editing. Moreover, this task poses additional difficulties regarding the re-productivity of such editing. To address this, we propose Dynamic Multi-Gaussian Soup (D-MiSo), which allows us to model the mesh-inspired representation of dynamic GS. Additionally, we propose a strategy of linking parameterized Gaussian splats, forming a Triangle Soup with the estimated mesh. Consequently, we can separately construct new trajectories for the 3D objects composing the scene. Thus, we can make the scene's dynamic editable over time or while maintaining partial dynamics.",

The proposed temporal radial basis function Gaussian residual utilizes Gaussian parameter interpolation over time, enabling smooth parameter transitions and capturing temporal residuals of Gaussian distributions. Additionally, a 4D Gaussian deformation field tracks the evolution of these parameters, creating continuous spatiotemporal deformation fields. A 4D neural field transforms low-dimensional spatiotemporal coordinates ($x,y,z,t$) into a high-dimensional latent space. Finally, we adaptively and efficiently fuse the latent features from neural fields and the geometric features from Gaussian deformation fields.

With its superior rendering performance and high-fidelity rendering quality, 3DGS is excelling at its previous NeRF counterparts. The most recent 3DGS method focuses either on improving the instability of rendering efficiency or reducing the model size. On the other hand, the training efficiency of 3DGS on large-scale scenes has not gained much attention. In this work, we propose DoGaussian, a method that trains 3DGS distributedly. Our method first decomposes a scene into K blocks and then introduces the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) into the training procedure of 3DGS. During training, our DOGS maintains one global 3DGS model on the master node and K local 3DGS models on the slave nodes. The K local 3DGS models are dropped after training and we only query the global 3DGS model during inference. The training time is reduced by scene decomposition, and the training convergence and stability are guaranteed through the consensus on the shared 3D Gaussians. Our method accelerates the training of 3DGS by 6+ times when evaluated on large-scale scenes while concurrently achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality.

Notably, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant milestone by adopting a discrete scene representation, facilitating efficient training and real-time rendering. Several studies have successfully extended the real-time rendering capability of 3DGS to dynamic scenes. However, a challenge arises when training images are captured under vastly differing weather and lighting conditions. This scenario poses a challenge for 3DGS and its variants in achieving accurate reconstructions. Although NeRF-based methods (NeRF-W, CLNeRF) have shown promise in handling such challenging conditions, their computational demands hinder real-time rendering capabilities. In this paper, we present Gaussian Time Machine (GTM) which models the time-dependent attributes of Gaussian primitives with discrete time embedding vectors decoded by a lightweight Multi-Layer-Perceptron(MLP). By adjusting the opacity of Gaussian primitives, we can reconstruct visibility changes of objects. We further propose a decomposed color model for improved geometric consistency. GTM achieved state-of-the-art rendering fidelity on 3 datasets and is 100 times faster than NeRF-based counterparts in rendering.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown a powerful capability for novel view synthesis due to its detailed expressive ability and highly efficient rendering speed. Unfortunately, creating relightable 3D assets with 3DGS is still problematic, particularly for reflective objects, as its discontinuous representation raises difficulties in constraining geometries. Inspired by previous works, the signed distance field (SDF) can serve as an effective way for geometry regularization. However, a direct incorporation between Gaussians and SDF significantly slows training. To this end, we propose GS-ROR for reflective objects relighting with 3DGS aided by SDF priors. At the core of our method is the mutual supervision of the depth and normal between deferred Gaussians and SDF, which avoids the expensive volume rendering of SDF. Thanks to this mutual supervision, the learned deferred Gaussians are well-constrained with a minimal time cost. As the Gaussians are rendered in a deferred shading mode, while the alpha-blended Gaussians are smooth, individual Gaussians may still be outliers, yielding floater artifacts. Therefore, we further introduce an SDF-aware pruning strategy to remove Gaussian outliers, which are located distant from the surface defined by SDF, avoiding the floater issue. Consequently, our method outperforms the existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods in terms of relighting quality. Our method also exhibits competitive relighting quality compared to NeRF-based methods with at most 25% of training time and allows rendering at 200+ frames per second on an RTX4090.",

It presents notable challenges in achieving realistic clothing deformation. Current methodologies often overlook the influence of motion on surface deformation, resulting in surfaces lacking the constraints imposed by global motion. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative framework, Motion-Based 3D Clo}thed Humans Synthesis (MOSS), which employs kinematic information to achieve motion-aware Gaussian split on the human surface. Our framework consists of two modules: Kinematic Gaussian Locating Splatting (KGAS) and Surface Deformation Detector (UID). KGAS incorporates matrix-Fisher distribution to propagate global motion across the body surface. The density and rotation factors of this distribution explicitly control the Gaussians, thereby enhancing the realism of the reconstructed surface. Additionally, to address local occlusions in single-view, based on KGAS, UID identifies significant surfaces, and geometric reconstruction is performed to compensate for these deformations. Experimental results demonstrate that MOSS achieves state-of-the-art visual quality in 3D clothed human synthesis from monocular videos. Notably, we improve the Human NeRF and the Gaussian Splatting by 33.94% and 16.75% in LPIPS* respectively. Codes are available at https://wanghongsheng01.github.io/MOSS/.",

By decoupling garments from avatar, our framework empowers users to conviniently edit avatars at the garment level. Our approach begins by modeling the avatar using a set of Gaussian points organized in a layered structure, where each layer corresponds to a specific garment or the human body itself. To generate high-quality garments for each layer, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy for diverse garment generation and a novel dual-SDS loss function to maintain coherence between the generated garments and avatar components, including the human body and other garments. Moreover, we introduce three regularization losses to guide the movement of Gaussians for garment transfer, allowing garments to be freely transferred to various avatars.

    "abstract": "Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently made progress in 3D human reconstruction, it primarily relies on 2D pixel-level supervision, overlooking the geometric complexity and topological relationships of different body parts. To address this gap, we introduce the Hierarchical Graph Human Gaussian Control (HUGS) framework for achieving high-fidelity 3D human reconstruction. Our approach involves leveraging explicitly semantic priors of body parts to ensure the consistency of geometric topology, thereby enabling the capture of the complex geometrical and topological associations among body parts. Additionally, we disentangle high-frequency features from global human features to refine surface details in body parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits superior performance in human body reconstruction, particularly in enhancing surface details and accurately reconstructing body part junctions.

    "abstract": "Traditional 3D garment creation is labor-intensive, involving sketching, modeling, UV mapping, and texturing, which are time-consuming and costly. Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have enabled new possibilities for 3D garment generation from text prompts, images, and videos. However, existing methods either suffer from inconsistencies among multi-view images or require additional processes to separate cloth from the underlying human model. In this paper, we propose GarmentDreamer, a novel method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as guidance to generate wearable, simulation-ready 3D garment meshes from text prompts. In contrast to using multi-view images directly predicted by generative models as guidance, our 3DGS guidance ensures consistent optimization in both garment deformation and texture synthesis. Our method introduces a novel garment augmentation module, guided by normal and RGBA information, and employs implicit Neural Texture Fields (NeTF) combined with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to generate diverse geometric and texture details. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, showcasing the superior performance of GarmentDreamer over state-of-the-art alternatives.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently advanced radiance field reconstruction by offering superior capabilities for novel view synthesis and real-time rendering speed. However, its strategy of blending optimization and adaptive density control might lead to sub-optimal results; it can sometimes yield noisy geometry and blurry artifacts due to prioritizing optimizing large Gaussians at the cost of adequately densifying smaller ones. To address this, we introduce AtomGS, consisting of Atomized Proliferation and Geometry-Guided Optimization. The Atomized Proliferation constrains ellipsoid Gaussians of various sizes into more uniform-sized Atom Gaussians. The strategy enhances the representation of areas with fine features by placing greater emphasis on densification in accordance with scene details. In addition, we proposed a Geometry-Guided Optimization approach that incorporates an Edge-Aware Normal Loss. This optimization method effectively smooths flat surfaces while preserving intricate details. Our evaluation shows that AtomGS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality. Additionally, it achieves competitive accuracy in geometry reconstruction and offers a significant improvement in training speed over other SDF-based methods.

    "abstract": "The efficient representation, transmission, and reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) contents are becoming increasingly important for sixth-generation (6G) networks that aim to merge virtual and physical worlds for offering immersive communication experiences. Neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) have recently emerged as two promising 3D representation techniques based on radiance field rendering, which are able to provide photorealistic rendering results for complex scenes. Therefore, embracing NeRF and 3D-GS in 6G networks is envisioned to be a prominent solution to support emerging 3D applications with enhanced quality of experience. This paper provides a comprehensive overview on the integration of NeRF and 3D-GS in 6G. First, we review the basics of the radiance field rendering techniques, and highlight their applications and implementation challenges over wireless networks. Next, we consider the over-the-air training of NeRF and 3D-GS models over wireless networks by presenting various learning techniques. We particularly focus on the federated learning design over a hierarchical device-edge-cloud architecture, which is suitable for exploiting distributed data and computing resources over 6G networks to train large models representing large-scale scenes. Then, we consider the over-the-air rendering of NeRF and 3D-GS models at wireless network edge. We present three practical rendering architectures, namely local, remote, and co-rendering, respectively, and provide model compression approaches to facilitate the transmission of radiance field models for rendering. We also present rendering acceleration approaches and joint computation and communication designs to enhance the rendering efficiency. In a case study, we propose a new semantic communication enabled 3D content transmission design.",

With sparse training views, 3DGS easily suffers from overfitting, negatively impacting rendering. This paper introduces a new co-regularization perspective for improving sparse-view 3DGS. When training two 3D Gaussian radiance fields, we observe that the two radiance fields exhibit point disagreement and rendering disagreement that can unsupervisedly predict reconstruction quality, stemming from the randomness of densification implementation. We further quantify the two disagreements and demonstrate the negative correlation between them and accurate reconstruction, which allows us to identify inaccurate reconstruction without accessing ground-truth information. Based on the study, we propose CoR-GS, which identifies and suppresses inaccurate reconstruction based on the two disagreements: (1) Co-pruning considers Gaussians that exhibit high point disagreement in inaccurate positions and prunes them. (2) Pseudo-view co-regularization considers pixels that exhibit high rendering disagreement are inaccurate and suppress the disagreement. Results on LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and Blender demonstrate that CoR-GS effectively regularizes the scene geometry, reconstructs the compact representations, and achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis quality under sparse training views.",

    "abstract": "By equipping the most recent 3D Gaussian Splatting representation with head 3D morphable models (3DMM), existing methods manage to create head avatars with high fidelity. However, most existing methods only reconstruct a head without the body, substantially limiting their application scenarios. We found that naively applying Gaussians to model the clothed chest and shoulders tends to result in blurry reconstruction and noisy floaters under novel poses. This is because of the fundamental limitation of Gaussians and point clouds -- each Gaussian or point can only have a single directional radiance without spatial variance, therefore an unnecessarily large number of them is required to represent complicated spatially varying texture, even for simple geometry. In contrast, we propose to model the body part with a neural texture that consists of coarse and pose-dependent fine colors. To properly render the body texture for each view and pose without accurate geometry nor UV mapping, we optimize another sparse set of Gaussians as anchors that constrain the neural warping field that maps image plane coordinates to the texture space. We demonstrate that Gaussian Head & Shoulders can fit the high-frequency details on the clothed upper body with high fidelity and potentially improve the accuracy and fidelity of the head region. We evaluate our method with casual phone-captured and internet videos and show our method archives superior reconstruction quality and robustness in both self and cross reenactment tasks. To fully utilize the efficient rendering speed of Gaussian splatting, we additionally propose an accelerated inference method of our trained model without Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) queries and reach a stable rendering speed of around 130 FPS for any subjects.",

Unlike ISM which adopts the inversion process of DDIM to calculate on a single path, our TSM method leverages the inversion process of DDIM to generate two paths from the same starting point for calculation. Since both paths start from the same starting point, TSM can reduce the accumulated error compared to ISM, thus alleviating the problem of pseudo ground truth inconsistency. TSM enhances the stability and consistency of the model's generated paths during the distillation process. We demonstrate this experimentally and further show that ISM is a special case of TSM. Furthermore, to optimize the current multi-stage optimization process from high-resolution text to 3D generation, we adopt Stable Diffusion XL for guidance. In response to the issues of abnormal replication and splitting caused by unstable gradients during the 3D Gaussian splatting process when using Stable Diffusion XL, we propose a pixel-by-pixel gradient clipping method.

We develop a procedure to convert back and forth between the two. Our approach achieves the best of both NeRFs (superior PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS on dissimilar views, and a compact representation) and GS (real-time rendering and ability for easily modifying the representation); the computational cost of these conversions is minor compared to training the two from scratch.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prominence of e-commerce has underscored the importance of Virtual Try-On (VTON). However, previous studies predominantly focus on the 2D realm and rely heavily on extensive data for training. Research on 3D VTON primarily centers on garment-body shape compatibility, a topic extensively covered in 2D VTON. Thanks to advances in 3D scene editing, a 2D diffusion model has now been adapted for 3D editing via multi-viewpoint editing. In this work, we propose GaussianVTON, an innovative 3D VTON pipeline integrating Gaussian Splatting (GS) editing with 2D VTON. To facilitate a seamless transition from 2D to 3D VTON, we propose, for the first time, the use of only images as editing prompts for 3D editing. To further address issues, e.g., face blurring, garment inaccuracy, and degraded viewpoint quality during editing, we devise a three-stage refinement strategy to gradually mitigate potential issues. Furthermore, we introduce a new editing strategy termed Edit Recall Reconstruction (ERR) to tackle the limitations of previous editing strategies in leading to complex geometric changes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GaussianVTON, offering a novel perspective on 3D VTON while also establishing a novel starting point for image-prompting 3D scene editing.",

    "abstract": "Animatable clothing transfer, aiming at dressing and animating garments across characters, is a challenging problem. Most human avatar works entangle the representations of the human body and clothing together, which leads to difficulties for virtual try-on across identities. What's worse, the entangled representations usually fail to exactly track the sliding motion of garments. To overcome these limitations, we present Layered Gaussian Avatars (LayGA), a new representation that formulates body and clothing as two separate layers for photorealistic animatable clothing transfer from multi-view videos. Our representation is built upon the Gaussian map-based avatar for its excellent representation power of garment details. However, the Gaussian map produces unstructured 3D Gaussians distributed around the actual surface. The absence of a smooth explicit surface raises challenges in accurate garment tracking and collision handling between body and garments. Therefore, we propose two-stage training involving single-layer reconstruction and multi-layer fitting. In the single-layer reconstruction stage, we propose a series of geometric constraints to reconstruct smooth surfaces and simultaneously obtain the segmentation between body and clothing. Next, in the multi-layer fitting stage, we train two separate models to represent body and clothing and utilize the reconstructed clothing geometries as 3D supervision for more accurate garment tracking. Furthermore, we propose geometry and rendering layers for both high-quality geometric reconstruction and high-fidelity rendering. Overall, the proposed LayGA realizes photorealistic animations and virtual try-on, and outperforms other baseline methods. Our project page is https://jsnln.github.io/layga/index.html.",

    "abstract": "Accurately reconstructing a 3D scene including explicit geometry information is both attractive and challenging. Geometry reconstruction can benefit from incorporating differentiable appearance models, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods encounter efficiency issues due to indirect geometry learning and the paradigm of separately modeling geometry and surface appearance. In this work, we propose a learnable scene model that incorporates 3DGS with an explicit geometry representation, namely a mesh. Our model learns the mesh and appearance in an end-to-end manner, where we bind 3D Gaussians to the mesh faces and perform differentiable rendering of 3DGS to obtain photometric supervision. The model creates an effective information pathway to supervise the learning of both 3DGS and mesh. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned scene model not only achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and rendering quality but also supports manipulation using the explicit mesh. In addition, our model has a unique advantage in adapting to scene updates, thanks to the end-to-end learning of both mesh and appearance.",

Gaussian Splatting has demonstrated its advantages in implicit 3D reconstruction, compared with the original Neural Radiance Fields. As the rapid development of technologies and principles, people tried to used the Stable Diffusion models to generate targeted models with text instructions. However, using the normal implicit machine learning methods is hard to gain the precise motions and actions control, further more, it is difficult to generate a long content and semantic continuous 3D video. To address this issue, we propose the OneTo3D, a method and theory to used one single image to generate the editable 3D model and generate the targeted semantic continuous time-unlimited 3D video. We used a normal basic Gaussian Splatting model to generate the 3D model from a single image, which requires less volume of video memory and computer calculation ability. Subsequently, we designed an automatic generation and self-adaptive binding mechanism for the object armature. Combined with the re-editable motions and actions analyzing and controlling algorithm we proposed, we can achieve a better performance than the SOTA projects in the area of building the 3D model precise motions and actions control, and generating a stable semantic continuous time-unlimited 3D video with the input text instructions.

To Address this issue, we propose the I3DS, a synthetic model performance improvement evaluation solution and experiments test. From multiple and important levels or dimensions of the original 3D Gaussian Splatting, we made more than two thousand various kinds of experiments to test how the selected different items and components can make an impact on the training efficiency of the 3D Gaussian Splatting model. In this paper, we will share abundant and meaningful experiences and methods about how to improve the training, performance and the impacts caused by different items of the model. A special but normal Integer compression in base 95 and a floating-point compression in base 94 with ASCII encoding and decoding mechanism is presented.

To address these limitations, we jointly optimize sparse visual odometry tracking and 3D Gaussian Splatting scene representation for the first time. We obtain depth maps on visual odometry keyframe windows using a fast Multi-View Stereo (MVS) network for the geometric supervision of Gaussian maps. Furthermore, we propose a depth smooth loss and Sparse-Dense Adjustment Ring (SDAR) to reduce the negative effect of estimated depth maps and preserve the consistency in scale between the visual odometry and Gaussian maps. We have evaluated our system across various synthetic and real-world datasets. The accuracy of our pose estimation surpasses existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art.

This framework enables users to perform drag-based editing on pre-trained 3D Gaussian object models, producing modified 2D images through multi-view consistent editing.

    "abstract": "Text-driven 3D indoor scene generation holds broad applications, ranging from gaming and smart homes to AR/VR applications. Fast and high-fidelity scene generation is paramount for ensuring user-friendly experiences. However, existing methods are characterized by lengthy generation processes or necessitate the intricate manual specification of motion parameters, which introduces inconvenience for users. Furthermore, these methods often rely on narrow-field viewpoint iterative generations, compromising global consistency and overall scene quality. To address these issues, we propose FastScene, a framework for fast and higher-quality 3D scene generation, while maintaining the scene consistency. Specifically, given a text prompt, we generate a panorama and estimate its depth, since the panorama encompasses information about the entire scene and exhibits explicit geometric constraints. To obtain high-quality novel views, we introduce the Coarse View Synthesis (CVS) and Progressive Novel View Inpainting (PNVI) strategies, ensuring both scene consistency and view quality. Subsequently, we utilize Multi-View Projection (MVP) to form perspective views, and apply 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for scene reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate FastScene surpasses other methods in both generation speed and quality with better scene consistency. Notably, guided only by a text prompt, FastScene can generate a 3D scene within a mere 15 minutes, which is at least one hour faster than state-of-the-art methods, making it a paradigm for user-friendly scene generation.",

Even with some techniques such as pruning or distillation, the results are still dense. In this paper, we propose to model the gradient of the original signal. The gradients are much sparser than the original signal. Therefore, the gradients use much less Gaussian splats, leading to the more efficient storage and thus higher computational performance during both training and rendering. Thanks to the sparsity, during the view synthesis, only a small mount of pixels are needed, leading to much higher computational performance ($100\\sim 1000\\times$ faster). And the 2D image can be recovered from the gradients via solving a Poisson equation with linear computation complexity. Several experiments are performed to confirm the sparseness of the gradients and the computation performance of the proposed method.

ASK-Splat enables geometric, semantic, and affordance understanding of 3D scenes, which is critical in many robotics tasks; (ii) SEE-Splat, a real-time scene-editing module using 3D semantic masking and infilling to visualize the motions of objects that result from robot interactions in the real-world.

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis from a sparse set of input images is a challenging problem of great practical interest, especially when camera poses are absent or inaccurate. Direct optimization of camera poses and usage of estimated depths in neural radiance field algorithms usually do not produce good results because of the coupling between poses and depths, and inaccuracies in monocular depth estimation. In this paper, we leverage the recent 3D Gaussian splatting method to develop a novel construct-and-optimize method for sparse view synthesis without camera poses. Specifically, we construct a solution progressively by using monocular depth and projecting pixels back into the 3D world. During construction, we optimize the solution by detecting 2D correspondences between training views and the corresponding rendered images. We develop a unified differentiable pipeline for camera registration and adjustment of both camera poses and depths, followed by back-projection. We also introduce a novel notion of an expected surface in Gaussian splatting, which is critical to our optimization. These steps enable a coarse solution, which can then be low-pass filtered and refined using standard optimization methods. We demonstrate results on the Tanks and Temples and Static Hikes datasets with as few as three widely-spaced views, showing significantly better quality than competing methods, including those with approximate camera pose information. Moreover, our results improve with more views and outperform previous InstantNGP and Gaussian Splatting algorithms even when using half the dataset.

Among these, 3D Gaussian Splatting stands out for its explicit representation of scenes using 3D Gaussians, making it appealing for tasks like 3D point cloud extraction and surface reconstruction. Motivated by its potential, we address the domain of 3D scene reconstruction, aiming to leverage the capabilities of the Microsoft HoloLens 2 for instant 3D Gaussian Splatting. We present HoloGS, a novel workflow utilizing HoloLens sensor data, which bypasses the need for pre-processing steps like Structure from Motion by instantly accessing the required input data i.e. the images, camera poses and the point cloud from depth sensing. We provide comprehensive investigations, including the training process and the rendering quality, assessed through the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, and the geometric 3D accuracy of the densified point cloud from Gaussian centers, measured by Chamfer Distance. We evaluate our approach on two self-captured scenes: An outdoor scene of a cultural heritage statue and an indoor scene of a fine-structured plant. Our results show that the HoloLens data, including RGB images, corresponding camera poses, and depth sensing based point clouds to initialize the Gaussians, are suitable as input for 3D Gaussian Splatting.",

    "abstract": "Surgical scene simulation plays a crucial role in surgical education and simulator-based robot learning. Traditional approaches for creating these environments with surgical scene involve a labor-intensive process where designers hand-craft tissues models with textures and geometries for soft body simulations. This manual approach is not only time-consuming but also limited in the scalability and realism. In contrast, data-driven simulation offers a compelling alternative. It has the potential to automatically reconstruct 3D surgical scenes from real-world surgical video data, followed by the application of soft body physics. This area, however, is relatively uncharted. In our research, we introduce 3D Gaussian as a learnable representation for surgical scene, which is learned from stereo endoscopic video. To prevent over-fitting and ensure the geometrical correctness of these scenes, we incorporate depth supervision and anisotropy regularization into the Gaussian learning process. Furthermore, we apply the Material Point Method, which is integrated with physical properties, to the 3D Gaussians to achieve realistic scene deformations. Our method was evaluated on our collected in-house and public surgical videos datasets. Results show that it can reconstruct and simulate surgical scenes from endoscopic videos efficiently-taking only a few minutes to reconstruct the surgical scene-and produce both visually and physically plausible deformations at a speed approaching real-time. The results demonstrate great potential of our proposed method to enhance the efficiency and variety of simulations available for surgical education and robot learning.",

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting, as a novel 3D representation, has garnered attention for its fast rendering speed and high rendering quality. However, this comes with high memory consumption, e.g., a well-trained Gaussian field may utilize three million Gaussian primitives and over 700 MB of memory. We credit this high memory footprint to the lack of consideration for the relationship between primitives. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient Gaussian field named SUNDAE with spectral pruning and neural compensation. On one hand, we construct a graph on the set of Gaussian primitives to model their relationship and design a spectral down-sampling module to prune out primitives while preserving desired signals. On the other hand, to compensate for the quality loss of pruning Gaussians, we exploit a lightweight neural network head to mix splatted features, which effectively compensates for quality losses while capturing the relationship between primitives in its weights. We demonstrate the performance of SUNDAE with extensive results. For example, SUNDAE can achieve 26.80 PSNR at 145 FPS using 104 MB memory while the vanilla Gaussian splatting algorithm achieves 25.60 PSNR at 160 FPS using 523 MB memory, on the Mip-NeRF360 dataset.

    "abstract": "We present Real-time Gaussian SLAM (RTG-SLAM), a real-time 3D reconstruction system with an RGBD camera for large-scale environments using Gaussian splatting. The system features a compact Gaussian representation and a highly efficient on-the-fly Gaussian optimization scheme. We force each Gaussian to be either opaque or nearly transparent, with the opaque ones fitting the surface and dominant colors, and transparent ones fitting residual colors. By rendering depth in a different way from color rendering, we let a single opaque Gaussian well fit a local surface region without the need of multiple overlapping Gaussians, hence largely reducing the memory and computation cost. For on-the-fly Gaussian optimization, we explicitly add Gaussians for three types of pixels per frame: newly observed, with large color errors, and with large depth errors. We also categorize all Gaussians into stable and unstable ones, where the stable Gaussians are expected to well fit previously observed RGBD images and otherwise unstable. We only optimize the unstable Gaussians and only render the pixels occupied by unstable Gaussians. In this way, both the number of Gaussians to be optimized and pixels to be rendered are largely reduced, and the optimization can be done in real time. We show real-time reconstructions of a variety of large scenes. Compared with the state-of-the-art NeRF-based RGBD SLAM, our system achieves comparable high-quality reconstruction but with around twice the speed and half the memory cost, and shows superior performance in the realism of novel view synthesis and camera tracking accuracy.",

In contrast to previous LRMs that can only reconstruct objects, by predicting per-pixel Gaussians, GS-LRM naturally handles scenes with large variations in scale and complexity. We show that our model can work on both object and scene captures by training it on Objaverse and RealEstate10K respectively.

This paper introduces score-based iterative reconstruction (SIR), an efficient and general algorithm mimicking a differentiable 3D reconstruction process to reduce the NFEs and enable optimization in pixel space. Given a single set of images sampled from a multi-view score-based diffusion model, SIR repeatedly optimizes 3D parameters, unlike the single-step optimization in SDS. With other improvements in training, we present an efficient approach called MicroDreamer that generally applies to various 3D representations and 3D generation tasks. In particular, MicroDreamer is 5-20 times faster than SDS in generating neural radiance field while retaining a comparable performance and takes about 20 seconds to create meshes from 3D Gaussian splatting on a single A100 GPU, halving the time of the fastest optimization-based baseline DreamGaussian with significantly superior performance compared to the measurement standard deviation.

    "abstract": "Following the advent of NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has paved the way to real-time neural rendering overcoming the computational burden of volumetric methods. Following the pioneering work of 3D-GS, several methods have attempted to achieve compressible and high-fidelity performance alternatives. However, by employing a geometry-agnostic optimization scheme, these methods neglect the inherent 3D structure of the scene, thereby restricting the expressivity and the quality of the representation, resulting in various floating points and artifacts. In this work, we propose a structure-aware Gaussian Splatting method (SAGS) that implicitly encodes the geometry of the scene, which reflects to state-of-the-art rendering performance and reduced storage requirements on benchmark novel-view synthesis datasets. SAGS is founded on a local-global graph representation that facilitates the learning of complex scenes and enforces meaningful point displacements that preserve the scene's geometry. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight version of SAGS, using a simple yet effective mid-point interpolation scheme, which showcases a compact representation of the scene with up to 24$\\times$ size reduction without the reliance on any compression strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of SAGS compared to state-of-the-art 3D-GS methods under both rendering quality and model size. Besides, we demonstrate that our structure-aware method can effectively mitigate floating artifacts and irregular distortions of previous methods while obtaining precise depth maps.

    "abstract": "Creating high-fidelity head avatars from multi-view videos is a core issue for many AR/VR applications. However, existing methods usually struggle to obtain high-quality renderings for all different head components simultaneously since they use one single representation to model components with drastically different characteristics (e.g., skin vs. hair). In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Mesh-Gaussian Head Avatar (MeGA) that models different head components with more suitable representations. Specifically, we select an enhanced FLAME mesh as our facial representation and predict a UV displacement map to provide per-vertex offsets for improved personalized geometric details. To achieve photorealistic renderings, we obtain facial colors using deferred neural rendering and disentangle neural textures into three meaningful parts. For hair modeling, we first build a static canonical hair using 3D Gaussian Splatting. A rigid transformation and an MLP-based deformation field are further applied to handle complex dynamic expressions. Combined with our occlusion-aware blending, MeGA generates higher-fidelity renderings for the whole head and naturally supports more downstream tasks. Experiments on the NeRSemble dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our designs, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods and supporting various editing functionalities, including hairstyle alteration and texture editing.",

A major disadvantage of this approach is the slow convergence caused by aggregating inconsistent information across views, as the guidance from 2D models is not multi-view consistent. We thus introduce the Direct Gaussian Editor (DGE), a method that addresses these issues in two stages. First, we modify a given high-quality image editor like InstructPix2Pix to be multi-view consistent. To do so, we propose a training-free approach that integrates cues from the 3D geometry of the underlying scene. Second, given a multi-view consistent edited sequence of images, we directly and efficiently optimize the 3D representation, which is based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Because it avoids incremental and iterative edits, DGE is significantly more accurate and efficient than existing approaches and offers additional benefits, such as enabling selective editing of parts of the scene.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in neural rendering techniques have greatly enhanced the rendering of photo-realistic 3D scenes across both academic and commercial fields. The latest method, known as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), has set new benchmarks for rendering quality and speed. Nevertheless, the limitations of 3D-GS become pronounced in synthesizing new viewpoints, especially for views that greatly deviate from those seen during training. Additionally, issues such as dilation and aliasing arise when zooming in or out. These challenges can all be traced back to a single underlying issue: insufficient sampling. In our paper, we present a bootstrapping method that significantly addresses this problem. This approach employs a diffusion model to enhance the rendering of novel views using trained 3D-GS, thereby streamlining the training process. Our results indicate that bootstrapping effectively reduces artifacts, as well as clear enhancements on the evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we show that our method is versatile and can be easily integrated, allowing various 3D reconstruction projects to benefit from our approach.",

    "abstract": "The advent of neural and Gaussian-based radiance field methods have achieved great success in the field of novel view synthesis. However, specular reflection remains non-trivial, as the high frequency radiance field is notoriously difficult to fit stably and accurately. We present a deferred shading method to effectively render specular reflection with Gaussian splatting. The key challenge comes from the environment map reflection model, which requires accurate surface normal while simultaneously bottlenecks normal estimation with discontinuous gradients. We leverage the per-pixel reflection gradients generated by deferred shading to bridge the optimization process of neighboring Gaussians, allowing nearly correct normal estimations to gradually propagate and eventually spread over all reflective objects. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and concurrent work in synthesizing high-quality specular reflection effects, demonstrating a consistent improvement of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for both synthetic and real-world scenes, while running at a frame rate almost identical to vanilla Gaussian splatting.",

To address these challenges, our approach begins with a comprehensive pre-processing workflow that encompasses deep learning-based image restoration, feature point extraction and camera pose initialization. We apply a customized Structure from Motion (SfM) approach, followed by an improved 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm, to achieve high-fidelity 3D model reconstruction. Our technique supports simultaneous 3D Gaussian training and pose estimation, enabling the robust generation of intricate 3D point clouds from sparse, noisy data. The procedure is further bolstered by a post-editing phase designed to eliminate noise points inconsistent with our prior knowledge of a satellite's geometric constraints. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets and actual observations of China's Space Station and International Space Station, showcasing its significant advantages over existing methods in reconstructing 3D space objects from ground-based observations.",

This is achieved by directly setting the z-scale of 3D Gaussian points to 0, effectively flattening the original 3D ellipsoid into a 2D ellipse. Such a design provides clear guidance to the optimizer. By treating the local z-axis as the normal direction, it greatly improves optimization stability and surface alignment. While the derivatives to the local z-axis computed from the covariance matrix are zero in this setting, we design a self-supervised normal-depth consistency loss to remedy this issue. Monocular normal priors and foreground masks are incorporated to enhance the quality of the reconstruction, mitigating issues related to highlights and background. We propose a volumetric cutting method to aggregate the information of Gaussian surfels so as to remove erroneous points in depth maps generated by alpha blending. Finally, we apply screened Poisson reconstruction method to the fused depth maps to extract the surface mesh. Experimental results show that our method demonstrates superior performance in surface reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art neural volume rendering and point-based rendering methods.",

Pose estimation is further aggravated since no GNSS measures are available as it is usual for such indoor applications. In our work, we realize data collection in a large factory hall by a robot system equipped with four stereo cameras as well as a 3D laser scanner.

    "abstract": "3D object generation has undergone significant advancements, yielding high-quality results. However, fall short of achieving precise user control, often yielding results that do not align with user expectations, thus limiting their applicability. User-envisioning 3D object generation faces significant challenges in realizing its concepts using current generative models due to limited interaction capabilities. Existing methods mainly offer two approaches: (i) interpreting textual instructions with constrained controllability, or (ii) reconstructing 3D objects from 2D images. Both of them limit customization to the confines of the 2D reference and potentially introduce undesirable artifacts during the 3D lifting process, restricting the scope for direct and versatile 3D modifications. In this work, we introduce Interactive3D, an innovative framework for interactive 3D generation that grants users precise control over the generative process through extensive 3D interaction capabilities. Interactive3D is constructed in two cascading stages, utilizing distinct 3D representations. The first stage employs Gaussian Splatting for direct user interaction, allowing modifications and guidance of the generative direction at any intermediate step through (i) Adding and Removing components, (ii) Deformable and Rigid Dragging, (iii) Geometric Transformations, and (iv) Semantic Editing. Subsequently, the Gaussian splats are transformed into InstantNGP. We introduce a novel (v) Interactive Hash Refinement module to further add details and extract the geometry in the second stage.

Current methods often regress Gaussians with pixel or point cloud correspondence, linking each Gaussian with a pixel or a 3D point. This leads to the redundancy of Gaussians being used to overfit the correspondence rather than the objects represented by the 3D Gaussians themselves, consequently wasting resources and lacking accurate geometries or textures. In this paper, we introduce LeanGaussian, a novel approach that treats each query in deformable Transformer as one 3D Gaussian ellipsoid, breaking the pixel or point cloud correspondence constraints. We leverage deformable decoder to iteratively refine the Gaussians layer-by-layer with the image features as keys and values. Notably, the center of each 3D Gaussian is defined as 3D reference points, which are then projected onto the image for deformable attention in 2D space. On both the ShapeNet SRN dataset (category level) and the Google Scanned Objects dataset (open-category level, trained with the Objaverse dataset), our approach, outperforms prior methods by approximately 6.1\\%, achieving a PSNR of 25.44 and 22.36, respectively.

It leverages the fast rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) while addressing the challenges of directly controlling 3DGS with speech audio. GaussianTalker constructs a canonical 3DGS representation of the head and deforms it in sync with the audio. A key insight is to encode the 3D Gaussian attributes into a shared implicit feature representation, where it is merged with audio features to manipulate each Gaussian attribute. This design exploits the spatial-aware features and enforces interactions between neighboring points. The feature embeddings are then fed to a spatial-audio attention module, which predicts frame-wise offsets for the attributes of each Gaussian. It is more stable than previous concatenation or multiplication approaches for manipulating the numerous Gaussians and their intricate parameters. Experimental results showcase GaussianTalker's superiority in facial fidelity, lip synchronization accuracy, and rendering speed compared to previous methods.

Despite these achievements, a notable challenge persists: it is difficult to precisely reconstruct specific objects from large scenes. Current scene reconstruction techniques frequently result in the loss of object detail textures and are unable to reconstruct object portions that are occluded or unseen in views. To address this challenge, we delve into the meticulous 3D reconstruction of specific objects within large scenes and propose a framework termed OMEGAS: Object Mesh Extraction from Large Scenes Guided by Gaussian Segmentation. Specifically, we proposed a novel 3D target segmentation technique based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which segments 3D consistent target masks in multi-view scene images and generates a preliminary target model. Moreover, to reconstruct the unseen portions of the target, we propose a novel target replenishment technique driven by large-scale generative diffusion priors. We demonstrate that our method can accurately reconstruct specific targets from large scenes, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our experiments show that OMEGAS significantly outperforms existing reconstruction methods across various scenarios. Our project page is at: https://github.com/CrystalWlz/OMEGAS",

To tackle this challenge, we introduce TalkingGaussian, a deformation-based radiance fields framework for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Leveraging the point-based Gaussian Splatting, facial motions can be represented in our method by applying smooth and continuous deformations to persistent Gaussian primitives, without requiring to learn the difficult appearance change like previous methods. Due to this simplification, precise facial motions can be synthesized while keeping a highly intact facial feature. Under such a deformation paradigm, we further identify a face-mouth motion inconsistency that would affect the learning of detailed speaking motions. To address this conflict, we decompose the model into two branches separately for the face and inside mouth areas, therefore simplifying the learning tasks to help reconstruct more accurate motion and structure of the mouth region. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method renders high-quality lip-synchronized talking head videos, with better facial fidelity and higher efficiency compared with previous methods.",

In particular, we address the scenarios with severely limited and sparse observations in 3D human reconstruction, a common challenge encountered in the real world.

We demonstrate our method can reconstruct high-quality animatable 3D humans in various challenging examples, in the presence of occlusion, image crops, few-shot, and extremely sparse observations.

Currently, it primarily focuses on geometry and appearance modeling, while lacking the semantic understanding of scenes. To bridge this gap, we present CLIP-GS, which integrates semantics from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) into Gaussian Splatting to efficiently comprehend 3D environments without annotated semantic data. In specific, rather than straightforwardly learning and rendering high-dimensional semantic features of 3D Gaussians, which significantly diminishes the efficiency, we propose a Semantic Attribute Compactness (SAC) approach. SAC exploits the inherent unified semantics within objects to learn compact yet effective semantic representations of 3D Gaussians, enabling highly efficient rendering (>100 FPS). Additionally, to address the semantic ambiguity, caused by utilizing view-inconsistent 2D CLIP semantics to supervise Gaussians, we introduce a 3D Coherent Self-training (3DCS) strategy, resorting to the multi-view consistency originated from the 3D model. 3DCS imposes cross-view semantic consistency constraints by leveraging refined, self-predicted pseudo-labels derived from the trained 3D Gaussian model, thereby enhancing precise and view-consistent segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method remarkably outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvements of 17.29% and 20.81% in mIoU metric on Replica and ScanNet datasets, respectively, while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior performance even with sparse input data, verifying the robustness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Recent works on audio-driven talking head synthesis using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved impressive results. However, due to inadequate pose and expression control caused by NeRF implicit representation, these methods still have some limitations, such as unsynchronized or unnatural lip movements, and visual jitter and artifacts. In this paper, we propose GaussianTalker, a novel method for audio-driven talking head synthesis based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. With the explicit representation property of 3D Gaussians, intuitive control of the facial motion is achieved by binding Gaussians to 3D facial models. GaussianTalker consists of two modules, Speaker-specific Motion Translator and Dynamic Gaussian Renderer. Speaker-specific Motion Translator achieves accurate lip movements specific to the target speaker through universalized audio feature extraction and customized lip motion generation. Dynamic Gaussian Renderer introduces Speaker-specific BlendShapes to enhance facial detail representation via a latent pose, delivering stable and realistic rendered videos. Extensive experimental results suggest that GaussianTalker outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in talking head synthesis, delivering precise lip synchronization and exceptional visual quality. Our method achieves rendering speeds of 130 FPS on NVIDIA RTX4090 GPU, significantly exceeding the threshold for real-time rendering performance, and can potentially be deployed on other hardware platforms.",

The main challenges of this task lie in the preservation of geometric consistency and the maintenance of texture coherence in the presence of the substantial discrete nature of Gaussian primitives. We introduce a robust framework specifically designed to overcome these obstacles. The key insight of our approach is the enhancement of information exchange among visible and invisible areas, facilitating content restoration in terms of both geometry and texture. Our methodology begins with optimizing the positioning of Gaussian primitives to improve geometric consistency across both removed and visible areas, guided by an online registration process informed by monocular depth estimation. Following this, we employ a novel feature propagation mechanism to bolster texture coherence, leveraging a cross-attention design that bridges sampling Gaussians from both uncertain and certain areas. This innovative approach significantly refines the texture coherence within the final radiance field. Extensive experiments validate that our method not only elevates the quality of novel view synthesis for scenes undergoing object removal but also showcases notable efficiency gains in training and rendering speeds.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, the research on 3D talking face does not go deeper as 2D talking face, in the aspect of lip-synchronization (lip-sync) and speech perception. To mind the gap between the two sub-fields, we propose a learning framework named Learn2Talk, which can construct a better 3D talking face network by exploiting two expertise points from the field of 2D talking face. Firstly, inspired by the audio-video sync network, a 3D sync-lip expert model is devised for the pursuit of lip-sync between audio and 3D facial motion. Secondly, a teacher model selected from 2D talking face methods is used to guide the training of the audio-to-3D motions regression network to yield more 3D vertex accuracy. Extensive experiments show the advantages of the proposed framework in terms of lip-sync, vertex accuracy and speech perception, compared with state-of-the-arts. Finally, we show two applications of the proposed framework: audio-visual speech recognition and speech-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting based avatar animation.",

Following this example, we train a model to include also a segmentation feature vector for each Gaussian. These can then be used for 3D scene segmentation, by clustering Gaussians according to their feature vectors; and to generate 2D segmentation masks, by projecting the Gaussians on a plane and $\\alpha$ blending over their segmentation features. Using a combination of contrastive learning and spatial regularization, our method can be trained on inconsistent 2D segmentation masks, and still learn to generate segmentation masks consistent across all views. Moreover, the resulting model is extremely accurate, improving the IoU accuracy of the predicted masks by $+8\\%$ over the state of the art. Code and trained models will be released soon.",

However, its application to large-scale, high-resolution scenes (exceeding 4k$\\times$4k pixels) is hindered by the excessive computational requirements for managing a large number of Gaussians. Addressing this, we introduce 'EfficientGS', an advanced approach that optimizes 3DGS for high-resolution, large-scale scenes. We analyze the densification process in 3DGS and identify areas of Gaussian over-proliferation. We propose a selective strategy, limiting Gaussian increase to key primitives, thereby enhancing the representational efficiency. Additionally, we develop a pruning mechanism to remove redundant Gaussians, those that are merely auxiliary to adjacent ones. For further enhancement, we integrate a sparse order increment for Spherical Harmonics (SH), designed to alleviate storage constraints and reduce training overhead. Our empirical evaluations, conducted on a range of datasets including extensive 4K+ aerial images, demonstrate that 'EfficientGS' not only expedites training and rendering times but also achieves this with a model size approximately tenfold smaller than conventional 3DGS while maintaining high rendering fidelity.",

To this end, we investigate various initialization strategies for Gaussian Splatting and delve into how volumetric reconstructions from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can be utilized to bypass the dependency on SFM data. Our findings demonstrate that random initialization can perform much better if carefully designed and that by employing a combination of improved initialization strategies and structure distillation from low-cost NeRF models, it is possible to achieve equivalent results, or at times even superior, to those obtained from SFM initialization.

    "abstract": "Modern 3D engines and graphics pipelines require mesh as a memory-efficient representation, which allows efficient rendering, geometry processing, texture editing, and many other downstream operations. However, it is still highly difficult to obtain high-quality mesh in terms of structure and detail from monocular visual observations. The problem becomes even more challenging for dynamic scenes and objects. To this end, we introduce Dynamic Gaussians Mesh (DG-Mesh), a framework to reconstruct a high-fidelity and time-consistent mesh given a single monocular video. Our work leverages the recent advancement in 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct the mesh sequence with temporal consistency from a video. Building on top of this representation, DG-Mesh recovers high-quality meshes from the Gaussian points and can track the mesh vertices over time, which enables applications such as texture editing on dynamic objects. We introduce the Gaussian-Mesh Anchoring, which encourages evenly distributed Gaussians, resulting better mesh reconstruction through mesh-guided densification and pruning on the deformed Gaussians. By applying cycle-consistent deformation between the canonical and the deformed space, we can project the anchored Gaussian back to the canonical space and optimize Gaussians across all time frames. During the evaluation on different datasets, DG-Mesh provides significantly better mesh reconstruction and rendering than baselines. Project page: https://www.liuisabella.com/DG-Mesh/",

Compared to 2D inpainting, the crux of inpainting 3D Gaussians is to figure out the rendering-relevant properties of the introduced points, whose optimization largely benefits from their initial 3D positions. To this end, we propose to guide the point initialization with an image-conditioned depth completion model, which learns to directly restore the depth map based on the observed image. Such a design allows our model to fill in depth values at an aligned scale with the original depth, and also to harness strong generalizability from largescale diffusion prior. Thanks to the more accurate depth completion, our approach, dubbed InFusion, surpasses existing alternatives with sufficiently better fidelity and efficiency under various complex scenarios. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of InFusion with several practical applications, such as inpainting with user-specific texture or with novel object insertion.",

To address this challenge, we propose DeblurGS, a method to optimize sharp 3D Gaussian Splatting from motion-blurred images, even with the noisy camera pose initialization. We restore a fine-grained sharp scene by leveraging the remarkable reconstruction capability of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach estimates the 6-Degree-of-Freedom camera motion for each blurry observation and synthesizes corresponding blurry renderings for the optimization process. Furthermore, we propose Gaussian Densification Annealing strategy to prevent the generation of inaccurate Gaussians at erroneous locations during the early training stages when camera motion is still imprecise.

We present the use of novel view synthesis via compressed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to overcome this restriction, and to even enable students to perform cinematic anatomy on lightweight and mobile devices. Our proposed pipeline first finds a set of camera poses that captures all potentially seen structures in the data. High-quality images are then generated with path tracing and converted into a compact 3DGS representation, consuming < 70 MB even for data sets of multiple GBs.

Our GOF is derived from ray-tracing-based volume rendering of 3D Gaussians, enabling direct geometry extraction from 3D Gaussians by identifying its levelset, without resorting to Poisson reconstruction or TSDF fusion as in previous work. We approximate the surface normal of Gaussians as the normal of the ray-Gaussian intersection plane, enabling the application of regularization that significantly enhances geometry. Furthermore, we develop an efficient geometry extraction method utilizing Marching Tetrahedra, where the tetrahedral grids are induced from 3D Gaussians and thus adapt to the scene's complexity. Our evaluations reveal that GOF surpasses existing 3DGS-based methods in surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Further, it compares favorably to or even outperforms, neural implicit methods in both quality and speed.",

Second, implicit representations based on neural networks are difficult to incorporate into explicit 3D scenes, such as VR environments or video games. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes these limitations by providing an explicit 3D representation that can be rendered efficiently at high frame rates. In this work, we present a novel approach that combines the high rendering quality of NeRF-based 3D-aware GANs with the flexibility and computational advantages of 3DGS.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) technique couples 3D Gaussian primitives with differentiable rasterization to achieve high-quality novel view synthesis results while providing advanced real-time rendering performance. However, due to the flaw of its adaptive density control strategy in 3D-GS, it frequently suffers from over-reconstruction issue in intricate scenes containing high-frequency details, leading to blurry rendered images. The underlying reason for the flaw has still been under-explored. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the cause of aforementioned artifacts, namely gradient collision, which prevents large Gaussians in over-reconstructed regions from splitting. To address this issue, we propose the novel homodirectional view-space positional gradient as the criterion for densification. Our strategy efficiently identifies large Gaussians in over-reconstructed regions, and recovers fine details by splitting. We evaluate our proposed method on various challenging datasets. The experimental results indicate that our approach achieves the best rendering quality with reduced or similar memory consumption. Our method is easy to implement and can be incorporated into a wide variety of most recent Gaussian Splatting-based methods. We will open source our codes upon formal publication.

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity as a novel explicit 3D representation. This approach relies on the representation power of Gaussian primitives to provide a high-quality rendering. However, primitives optimized at low resolution inevitably exhibit sparsity and texture deficiency, posing a challenge for achieving high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS). To address this problem, we propose Super-Resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting (SRGS) to perform the optimization in a high-resolution (HR) space. The sub-pixel constraint is introduced for the increased viewpoints in HR space, exploiting the sub-pixel cross-view information of the multiple low-resolution (LR) views. The gradient accumulated from more viewpoints will facilitate the densification of primitives. Furthermore, a pre-trained 2D super-resolution model is integrated with the sub-pixel constraint, enabling these dense primitives to learn faithful texture features. In general, our method focuses on densification and texture learning to effectively enhance the representation ability of primitives. Experimentally, our method achieves high rendering quality on HRNVS only with LR inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets such as Mip-NeRF 360 and Tanks & Temples. Related codes will be released upon acceptance.",

Conventional Structure from Motion (SfM) methods for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction often fail in these environments due to poor correspondence construction. To address these challenges, we introduce LetsGo, a LiDAR-assisted Gaussian splatting framework for large-scale garage modeling and rendering. We develop a handheld scanner, Polar, equipped with IMU, LiDAR, and a fisheye camera, to facilitate accurate data acquisition. Using this Polar device, we present the GarageWorld dataset, consisting of eight expansive garage scenes with diverse geometric structures, which will be made publicly available for further research. Our approach demonstrates that LiDAR point clouds collected by the Polar device significantly enhance a suite of 3D Gaussian splatting algorithms for garage scene modeling and rendering. We introduce a novel depth regularizer that effectively eliminates floating artifacts in rendered images. Additionally, we propose a multi-resolution 3D Gaussian representation designed for Level-of-Detail (LOD) rendering. This includes adapted scaling factors for individual levels and a random-resolution-level training scheme to optimize the Gaussians across different resolutions. This representation enables efficient rendering of large-scale garage scenes on lightweight devices via a web-based renderer. Experimental results on our GarageWorld dataset, as well as on ScanNet++ and KITTI-360, demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of rendering quality and resource efficiency.",

    "abstract": "While 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently become popular for neural rendering, current methods rely on carefully engineered cloning and splitting strategies for placing Gaussians, which can lead to poor-quality renderings, and reliance on a good initialization. In this work, we rethink the set of 3D Gaussians as a random sample drawn from an underlying probability distribution describing the physical representation of the scene-in other words, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Under this view, we show that the 3D Gaussian updates can be converted as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) updates by simply introducing noise. We then rewrite the densification and pruning strategies in 3D Gaussian Splatting as simply a deterministic state transition of MCMC samples, removing these heuristics from the framework. To do so, we revise the 'cloning' of Gaussians into a relocalization scheme that approximately preserves sample probability. To encourage efficient use of Gaussians, we introduce a regularizer that promotes the removal of unused Gaussians. On various standard evaluation scenes, we show that our method provides improved rendering quality, easy control over the number of Gaussians, and robustness to initialization.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian splatting, renowned for its exceptional rendering quality and efficiency, has emerged as a prominent technique in 3D scene representation. However, the substantial data volume of Gaussian splatting impedes its practical utility in real-world applications. Herein, we propose an efficient 3D scene representation, named Compressed Gaussian Splatting (CompGS), which harnesses compact Gaussian primitives for faithful 3D scene modeling with a remarkably reduced data size. To ensure the compactness of Gaussian primitives, we devise a hybrid primitive structure that captures predictive relationships between each other. Then, we exploit a small set of anchor primitives for prediction, allowing the majority of primitives to be encapsulated into highly compact residual forms. Moreover, we develop a rate-constrained optimization scheme to eliminate redundancies within such hybrid primitives, steering our CompGS towards an optimal trade-off between bitrate consumption and representation efficacy. Experimental results show that the proposed CompGS significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior compactness in 3D scene representation without compromising model accuracy and rendering quality.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing and editing 3D objects and scenes both play crucial roles in computer graphics and computer vision. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) can achieve realistic reconstruction and editing results but suffer from inefficiency in rendering. Gaussian splatting significantly accelerates rendering by rasterizing Gaussian ellipsoids. However, Gaussian splatting utilizes a single Spherical Harmonic (SH) function to model both texture and lighting, limiting independent editing capabilities of these components. Recently, attempts have been made to decouple texture and lighting with the Gaussian splatting representation but may fail to produce plausible geometry and decomposition results on reflective scenes. Additionally, the forward shading technique they employ introduces noticeable blending artifacts during relighting, as the geometry attributes of Gaussians are optimized under the original illumination and may not be suitable for novel lighting conditions. To address these issues, we introduce DeferredGS, a method for decoupling and editing the Gaussian splatting representation using deferred shading. To achieve successful decoupling, we model the illumination with a learnable environment map and define additional attributes such as texture parameters and normal direction on Gaussians, where the normal is distilled from a jointly trained signed distance function. More importantly, we apply deferred shading, resulting in more realistic relighting effects compared to previous methods. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DeferredGS in novel view synthesis and editing tasks.",

Nevertheless, generating 3D scenes characterized by multiple instances and intricate arrangements remains challenging. In this study, we present DreamScape, a method for creating highly consistent 3D scenes solely from textual descriptions, leveraging the strong 3D representation capabilities of Gaussian Splatting and the complex arrangement abilities of large language models (LLMs). Our approach involves a 3D Gaussian Guide ($3{DG^2}$) for scene representation, consisting of semantic primitives (objects) and their spatial transformations and relationships derived directly from text prompts using LLMs. This compositional representation allows for local-to-global optimization of the entire scene. A progressive scale control is tailored during local object generation, ensuring that objects of different sizes and densities adapt to the scene, which addresses training instability issue arising from simple blending in the subsequent global optimization stage. To mitigate potential biases of LLM priors, we model collision relationships between objects at the global level, enhancing physical correctness and overall realism. Additionally, to generate pervasive objects like rain and snow distributed extensively across the scene, we introduce a sparse initialization and densification strategy. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScape offers high usability and controllability, enabling the generation of high-fidelity 3D scenes from only text prompts and achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.",

However, their loss function only contains the $\\ell_1$ norm and the structural similarity between the rendered and input images, without considering the edges in these images. It is well-known that the edges in an image provide important information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Edge Guided Gaussian Splatting (EGGS) method that leverages the edges in the input images. More specifically, we give the edge region a higher weight than the flat region. With such edge guidance, the resulting Gaussian particles focus more on the edges instead of the flat regions. Moreover, such edge guidance does not crease the computation cost during the training and rendering stage. The experiments confirm that such simple edge-weighted loss function indeed improves about $1\\sim2$ dB on several difference data sets. With simply plugging in the edge guidance, the proposed method can improve all Gaussian splatting methods in different scenarios, such as human head modeling, building 3D reconstruction, etc.",

However, the majority of videos generated by recent works lack depth information and are confined to the constraints of 2D image space. In this paper, inspired by significant progress in the field of novel view synthesis (NVS) achieved by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), we propose LoopGaussian to elevate cinemagraph from 2D image space to 3D space using 3D Gaussian modeling. To achieve this, we first employ the 3D-GS method to reconstruct 3D Gaussian point clouds from multi-view images of static scenes,incorporating shape regularization terms to prevent blurring or artifacts caused by object deformation. We then adopt an autoencoder tailored for 3D Gaussian to project it into feature space. To maintain the local continuity of the scene, we devise SuperGaussian for clustering based on the acquired features. By calculating the similarity between clusters and employing a two-stage estimation method, we derive an Eulerian motion field to describe velocities across the entire scene. The 3D Gaussian points then move within the estimated Eulerian motion field. Through bidirectional animation techniques, we ultimately generate a 3D Cinemagraph that exhibits natural and seamlessly loopable dynamics. Experiment results validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating high-quality and visually appealing scene generation.

Most existing radiance-field-based SLAM systems mainly focus on bounded indoor environments, equipped with RGB-D or RGB sensors. However, they are prone to decline when expanding to unbounded scenes or encountering adverse conditions, such as violent motions and changing illumination. In contrast, oriented to general scenarios, our approach additionally tightly fuses LiDAR, IMU, and camera for robust pose estimation and photo-realistic online mapping. To compensate for regions unobserved by the LiDAR, we propose to integrate both the triangulated visual points from images and LiDAR points for initializing 3D Gaussians. In addition, the modeling of the sky and varying camera exposure have been realized for high-quality rendering. Notably, we implement our system purely with C++ and CUDA, and meticulously design a series of strategies to accelerate the online optimization of the Gaussian-based scene representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms its counterparts while maintaining real-time capability. Impressively, regarding photo-realistic mapping, our method with our estimated poses even surpasses all the compared approaches that utilize privileged ground-truth poses for mapping. Our code will be released on project page https://xingxingzuo.github.io/gaussian_lic.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for virtual reality applications has highlighted the significance of crafting immersive 3D assets. We present a text-to-3D 360$^{\\circ}$ scene generation pipeline that facilitates the creation of comprehensive 360$^{\\circ}$ scenes for in-the-wild environments in a matter of minutes. Our approach utilizes the generative power of a 2D diffusion model and prompt self-refinement to create a high-quality and globally coherent panoramic image. This image acts as a preliminary \"flat\" (2D) scene representation. Subsequently, it is lifted into 3D Gaussians, employing splatting techniques to enable real-time exploration. To produce consistent 3D geometry, our pipeline constructs a spatially coherent structure by aligning the 2D monocular depth into a globally optimized point cloud. This point cloud serves as the initial state for the centroids of 3D Gaussians. In order to address invisible issues inherent in single-view inputs, we impose semantic and geometric constraints on both synthesized and input camera views as regularizations. These guide the optimization of Gaussians, aiding in the reconstruction of unseen regions. In summary, our method offers a globally consistent 3D scene within a 360$^{\\circ}$ perspective, providing an enhanced immersive experience over existing techniques.

State-of-the-art algorithms are able to detect defects in increasingly difficult settings and data modalities. However, most current methods are not suited to address 3D objects captured from differing poses. While solutions using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been proposed, they suffer from excessive computation requirements, which hinder real-world usability. For this reason, we propose the novel 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework SplatPose which, given multi-view images of a 3D object, accurately estimates the pose of unseen views in a differentiable manner, and detects anomalies in them. We achieve state-of-the-art results in both training and inference speed, and detection performance, even when using less training data than competing methods. We thoroughly evaluate our framework using the recently proposed Pose-agnostic Anomaly Detection benchmark and its multi-pose anomaly detection (MAD) data set.",

    "abstract": "One of the most critical factors in achieving sharp Novel View Synthesis (NVS) using neural field methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is the quality of the training images. However, Conventional RGB cameras are susceptible to motion blur. In contrast, neuromorphic cameras like event and spike cameras inherently capture more comprehensive temporal information, which can provide a sharp representation of the scene as additional training data. Recent methods have explored the integration of event cameras to improve the quality of NVS. The event-RGB approaches have some limitations, such as high training costs and the inability to work effectively in the background. Instead, our study introduces a new method that uses the spike camera to overcome these limitations. By considering texture reconstruction from spike streams as ground truth, we design the Texture from Spike (TfS) loss. Since the spike camera relies on temporal integration instead of temporal differentiation used by event cameras, our proposed TfS loss maintains manageable training costs. It handles foreground objects with backgrounds simultaneously. We also provide a real-world dataset captured with our spike-RGB camera system to facilitate future research endeavors. We conduct extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our design can enhance novel view synthesis across NeRF and 3DGS. The code and dataset will be made available for public access.",

In this work, we formulate the compact 3D Gaussian learning as an end-to-end Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) problem and propose RDO-Gaussian that can achieve flexible and continuous rate control. RDO-Gaussian addresses two main issues that exist in current schemes: 1) Different from prior endeavors that minimize the rate under the fixed distortion, we introduce dynamic pruning and entropy-constrained vector quantization (ECVQ) that optimize the rate and distortion at the same time. 2) Previous works treat the colors of each Gaussian equally, while we model the colors of different regions and materials with learnable numbers of parameters. We verify our method on both real and synthetic scenes, showcasing that RDO-Gaussian greatly reduces the size of 3D Gaussian over 40x, and surpasses existing methods in rate-distortion performance.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a 3D geometry-aware deformable Gaussian Splatting method for dynamic view synthesis. Existing neural radiance fields (NeRF) based solutions learn the deformation in an implicit manner, which cannot incorporate 3D scene geometry. Therefore, the learned deformation is not necessarily geometrically coherent, which results in unsatisfactory dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting provides a new representation of the 3D scene, building upon which the 3D geometry could be exploited in learning the complex 3D deformation. Specifically, the scenes are represented as a collection of 3D Gaussian, where each 3D Gaussian is optimized to move and rotate over time to model the deformation. To enforce the 3D scene geometry constraint during deformation, we explicitly extract 3D geometry features and integrate them in learning the 3D deformation. In this way, our solution achieves 3D geometry-aware deformation modeling, which enables improved dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets prove the superiority of our solution, which achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Within colorectal cancer diagnostics, conventional colonoscopy techniques face critical limitations, including a limited field of view and a lack of depth information, which can impede the detection of precancerous lesions. Current methods struggle to provide comprehensive and accurate 3D reconstructions of the colonic surface which can help minimize the missing regions and reinspection for pre-cancerous polyps. Addressing this, we introduce 'Gaussian Pancakes', a method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) combined with a Recurrent Neural Network-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (RNNSLAM) system. By introducing geometric and depth regularization into the 3D GS framework, our approach ensures more accurate alignment of Gaussians with the colon surface, resulting in smoother 3D reconstructions with novel viewing of detailed textures and structures. Evaluations across three diverse datasets show that Gaussian Pancakes enhances novel view synthesis quality, surpassing current leading methods with a 18% boost in PSNR and a 16% improvement in SSIM. It also delivers over 100X faster rendering and more than 10X shorter training times, making it a practical tool for real-time applications. Hence, this holds promise for achieving clinical translation for better detection and diagnosis of colorectal cancer.",

Our main contribution is a more principled, pixel-error driven formulation for density control in 3DGS, leveraging an auxiliary, per-pixel error function as the criterion for densification. We further introduce a mechanism to control the total number of primitives generated per scene and correct a bias in the current opacity handling strategy of ADC during cloning operations.

    "abstract": "The evolution of 3D generative modeling has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for 3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model's inference in 3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly, this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments covering 5 text-to-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D's versatility to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 to 4 times. Additionally, Hash3D's integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly 30 seconds.

By utilizing stylization, users can achieve consistent artistic effects in 3D editing using a single reference style image, making it a user-friendly editing method. However, recent NeRF-based 3D stylization methods encounter efficiency issues that impact the user experience, and their implicit nature limits their ability to accurately transfer geometric pattern styles. Additionally, the ability for artists to apply flexible control over stylized scenes is considered highly desirable to foster an environment conducive to creative exploration. To address the above issues, we introduce StylizedGS, an efficient 3D neural style transfer framework with adaptable control over perceptual factors based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. We propose a filter-based refinement to eliminate floaters that affect the stylization effects in the scene reconstruction process. The nearest neighbor-based style loss is introduced to achieve stylization by fine-tuning the geometry and color parameters of 3DGS, while a depth preservation loss with other regularizations is proposed to prevent the tampering of geometry content. Moreover, facilitated by specially designed losses, StylizedGS enables users to control color, stylized scale, and regions during the stylization to possess customization capabilities. Our method achieves high-quality stylization results characterized by faithful brushstrokes and geometric consistency with flexible controls. Extensive experiments across various scenes and styles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method concerning both stylization quality and inference speed.",

GS represents a scene as a set of 3D Gaussians with varying opacities and employs a computationally efficient splatting operation along with analytical derivatives to compute the 3D Gaussian parameters given scene images captured from various viewpoints. Unfortunately, capturing surround view ($360^{\\circ}$ viewpoint) images is impossible or impractical in many real-world imaging scenarios, including underwater imaging, rooms inside a building, and autonomous navigation. In these restricted baseline imaging scenarios, the GS algorithm suffers from a well-known 'missing cone' problem, which results in poor reconstruction along the depth axis. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that using transient data (from sonars) allows us to address the missing cone problem by sampling high-frequency data along the depth axis. We extend the Gaussian splatting algorithms for two commonly used sonars and propose fusion algorithms that simultaneously utilize RGB camera data and sonar data. Through simulations, emulations, and hardware experiments across various imaging scenarios, we show that the proposed fusion algorithms lead to significantly better novel view synthesis (5 dB improvement in PSNR) and 3D geometry reconstruction (60% lower Chamfer distance).",

    "abstract": "Modeling and rendering photorealistic avatars is of crucial importance in many applications. Existing methods that build a 3D avatar from visual observations, however, struggle to reconstruct clothed humans. We introduce PhysAvatar, a novel framework that combines inverse rendering with inverse physics to automatically estimate the shape and appearance of a human from multi-view video data along with the physical parameters of the fabric of their clothes. For this purpose, we adopt a mesh-aligned 4D Gaussian technique for spatio-temporal mesh tracking as well as a physically based inverse renderer to estimate the intrinsic material properties. PhysAvatar integrates a physics simulator to estimate the physical parameters of the garments using gradient-based optimization in a principled manner. These novel capabilities enable PhysAvatar to create high-quality novel-view renderings of avatars dressed in loose-fitting clothes under motions and lighting conditions not seen in the training data. This marks a significant advancement towards modeling photorealistic digital humans using physically based inverse rendering with physics in the loop.

Our main contribution involves modeling motion blur as a Gaussian distribution over camera poses, allowing us to address both camera pose refinement and motion blur correction in a unified way. Additionally, we propose mechanisms for defocus blur compensation and for addressing color in-consistencies caused by ambient light, shadows, or due to camera-related factors like varying white balancing settings. Our proposed solutions integrate in a seamless way with the 3DGS formulation while maintaining its benefits in terms of training efficiency and rendering speed.

Our approach is inspired by the recently developed 3D Gaussians, which demonstrate remarkable capabilities in achieving high rendering quality and fast rendering speed. Specifically, our system fully utilizes the geometric structure information provided by solid-state LiDAR to address the problem of inaccurate depth encountered when relying solely on visual solutions in unbounded, outdoor scenarios. Additionally, we utilize 3D Gaussian point clouds, with the assistance of pixel-level gradient descent, to fully exploit the color information in photos, thereby achieving realistic rendering effects. To further bolster the robustness of our system, we designed a relocalization module, which assists in returning to the correct trajectory in the event of a localization failure.

Existing approaches utilize score distillation sampling to form the dynamic scene as dynamic NeRF or dense 3D Gaussians. However, these methods struggle to strike a balance among reference view alignment, spatio-temporal consistency, and motion fidelity under single-view conditions due to the implicit nature of NeRF or the intricate dense Gaussian motion prediction. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient, sparse-controlled video-to-4D framework named SC4D, that decouples motion and appearance to achieve superior video-to-4D generation. Moreover, we introduce Adaptive Gaussian (AG) initialization and Gaussian Alignment (GA) loss to mitigate shape degeneration issue, ensuring the fidelity of the learned motion and shape. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing methods in both quality and efficiency. In addition, facilitated by the disentangled modeling of motion and appearance of SC4D, we devise a novel application that seamlessly transfers the learned motion onto a diverse array of 4D entities according to textual descriptions.",

However, previous works fail to accurately reconstruct complex dynamic scenes. We attribute the failure to the design of the deformation field, which is built as a coordinate-based function. This approach is problematic because 3DGS is a mixture of multiple fields centered at the Gaussians, not just a single coordinate-based framework. To resolve this problem, we define the deformation as a function of per-Gaussian embeddings and temporal embeddings. Moreover, we decompose deformations as coarse and fine deformations to model slow and fast movements, respectively. Also, we introduce a local smoothness regularization for per-Gaussian embedding to improve the details in dynamic regions. Project page: https://jeongminb.github.io/e-d3dgs/",

First, DreamScene employs Formation Pattern Sampling (FPS), a multi-timestep sampling strategy guided by the formation patterns of 3D objects, to form fast, semantically rich, and high-quality representations. FPS uses 3D Gaussian filtering for optimization stability, and leverages reconstruction techniques to generate plausible textures. Second, DreamScene employs a progressive three-stage camera sampling strategy, specifically designed for both indoor and outdoor settings, to effectively ensure object-environment integration and scene-wide 3D consistency. Last, DreamScene enhances scene editing flexibility by integrating objects and environments, enabling targeted adjustments. Extensive experiments validate DreamScene's superiority over current state-of-the-art techniques, heralding its wide-ranging potential for diverse applications.

Specifically, we conduct a theoretical analysis of spherical camera model derivatives in 3D Gaussian Splatting. According to the derivatives, we then implement a new GPU-accelerated omnidirectional rasterizer that directly splats 3D Gaussians onto the equirectangular screen space for omnidirectional image rendering. We realize differentiable optimization of the omnidirectional radiance field without the requirement of cube-map rectification or tangent-plane approximation. Extensive experiments conducted in egocentric and roaming scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and high rendering speed using omnidirectional images.

We adapt the Gaussian Splatting framework to enable novel view synthesis in CT based on limited sets of 2D image projections and without the need for Structure from Motion (SfM) methodologies. Therefore, we reduce the total scanning duration and the amount of radiation dose the patient receives during the scan. We adapted the loss function to our use-case by encouraging a stronger background and foreground distinction using two sparsity promoting regularizers: a beta loss and a total variation (TV) loss. Finally, we initialize the Gaussian locations across the 3D space using a uniform prior distribution of where the brain's positioning would be expected to be within the field of view. We evaluate the performance of our model using brain CT scans from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset and demonstrate that the rendered novel views closely match the original projection views of the simulated scan, and have better performance than other implicit 3D scene representations methodologies. Furthermore, we empirically observe reduced training time compared to neural network based image synthesis for sparse-view CT image reconstruction. Finally, the memory requirements of the Gaussian Splatting representations are reduced by 17% compared to the equivalent voxel grid image representations.",

In this paper, we design a novel tightly coupled LiDAR-Camera Gaussian Splatting (TCLC-GS) to fully leverage the combined strengths of both LiDAR and camera sensors, enabling rapid, high-quality 3D reconstruction and novel view RGB/depth synthesis. TCLC-GS designs a hybrid explicit (colorized 3D mesh) and implicit (hierarchical octree feature) 3D representation derived from LiDAR-camera data, to enrich the properties of 3D Gaussians for splatting. 3D Gaussian's properties are not only initialized in alignment with the 3D mesh which provides more completed 3D shape and color information, but are also endowed with broader contextual information through retrieved octree implicit features. During the Gaussian Splatting optimization process, the 3D mesh offers dense depth information as supervision, which enhances the training process by learning of a robust geometry. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes Dataset validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Utilizing a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti, our method demonstrates fast training and achieves real-time RGB and depth rendering at 90 FPS in resolution of 1920x1280 (Waymo), and 120 FPS in resolution of 1600x900 (nuScenes) in urban scenarios.",

To overcome them, this paper proposes a novel generation paradigm Sketch3D to generate realistic 3D assets with shape aligned with the input sketch and color matching the textual description. Concretely, Sketch3D first instantiates the given sketch in the reference image through the shape-preserving generation process. Second, the reference image is leveraged to deduce a coarse 3D Gaussian prior, and multi-view style-consistent guidance images are generated based on the renderings of the 3D Gaussians. Finally, three strategies are designed to optimize 3D Gaussians, i.e., structural optimization via a distribution transfer mechanism, color optimization with a straightforward MSE loss and sketch similarity optimization with a CLIP-based geometric similarity loss. Extensive visual comparisons and quantitative analysis illustrate the advantage of our Sketch3D in generating realistic 3D assets while preserving consistency with the input.",

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for accurately representing scenes. However, despite its superior novel view synthesis capabilities, extracting the geometry of the scene directly from the Gaussian properties remains a challenge, as those are optimized based on a photometric loss. While some concurrent models have tried adding geometric constraints during the Gaussian optimization process, they still produce noisy, unrealistic surfaces.   We propose a novel approach for bridging the gap between the noisy 3DGS representation and the smooth 3D mesh representation, by injecting real-world knowledge into the depth extraction process. Instead of extracting the geometry of the scene directly from the Gaussian properties, we instead extract the geometry through a pre-trained stereo-matching model. We render stereo-aligned pairs of images corresponding to the original training poses, feed the pairs into a stereo model to get a depth profile, and finally fuse all of the profiles together to get a single mesh.   The resulting reconstruction is smoother, more accurate and shows more intricate details compared to other methods for surface reconstruction from Gaussian Splatting, while only requiring a small overhead on top of the fairly short 3DGS optimization process.   We performed extensive testing of the proposed method on in-the-wild scenes, obtained using a smartphone, showcasing its superior reconstruction abilities. Additionally, we tested the method on the Tanks and Temples and DTU benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results.",

However, effectively training large-scale 3DGS and rendering it in real-time across various scales remains challenging. This paper introduces CityGaussian (CityGS), which employs a novel divide-and-conquer training approach and Level-of-Detail (LoD) strategy for efficient large-scale 3DGS training and rendering. Specifically, the global scene prior and adaptive training data selection enables efficient training and seamless fusion. Based on fused Gaussian primitives, we generate different detail levels through compression, and realize fast rendering across various scales through the proposed block-wise detail levels selection and aggregation strategy.

    "abstract": "We present HAHA - a novel approach for animatable human avatar generation from monocular input videos. The proposed method relies on learning the trade-off between the use of Gaussian splatting and a textured mesh for efficient and high fidelity rendering. We demonstrate its efficiency to animate and render full-body human avatars controlled via the SMPL-X parametric model. Our model learns to apply Gaussian splatting only in areas of the SMPL-X mesh where it is necessary, like hair and out-of-mesh clothing. This results in a minimal number of Gaussians being used to represent the full avatar, and reduced rendering artifacts. This allows us to handle the animation of small body parts such as fingers that are traditionally disregarded. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two open datasets: SnapshotPeople and X-Humans. Our method demonstrates on par reconstruction quality to the state-of-the-art on SnapshotPeople, while using less than a third of Gaussians. HAHA outperforms previous state-of-the-art on novel poses from X-Humans both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

We show for the first time that using 3D Gaussians for map representation with unposed camera images and inertial measurements can enable accurate SLAM. Our method, MM3DGS, addresses the limitations of prior neural radiance field-based representations by enabling faster rendering, scale awareness, and improved trajectory tracking. Our framework enables keyframe-based mapping and tracking utilizing loss functions that incorporate relative pose transformations from pre-integrated inertial measurements, depth estimates, and measures of photometric rendering quality.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an implicit surface reconstruction method with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), namely 3DGSR, that allows for accurate 3D reconstruction with intricate details while inheriting the high efficiency and rendering quality of 3DGS. The key insight is incorporating an implicit signed distance field (SDF) within 3D Gaussians to enable them to be aligned and jointly optimized. First, we introduce a differentiable SDF-to-opacity transformation function that converts SDF values into corresponding Gaussians' opacities. This function connects the SDF and 3D Gaussians, allowing for unified optimization and enforcing surface constraints on the 3D Gaussians. During learning, optimizing the 3D Gaussians provides supervisory signals for SDF learning, enabling the reconstruction of intricate details. However, this only provides sparse supervisory signals to the SDF at locations occupied by Gaussians, which is insufficient for learning a continuous SDF. Then, to address this limitation, we incorporate volumetric rendering and align the rendered geometric attributes (depth, normal) with those derived from 3D Gaussians. This consistency regularization introduces supervisory signals to locations not covered by discrete 3D Gaussians, effectively eliminating redundant surfaces outside the Gaussian sampling range. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our 3DGSR method enables high-quality 3D surface reconstruction while preserving the efficiency and rendering quality of 3DGS. Besides, our method competes favorably with leading surface reconstruction techniques while offering a more efficient learning process and much better rendering qualities.

    "abstract": "While neural 3D reconstruction has advanced substantially, it typically requires densely captured multi-view data with carefully initialized poses (e.g., using COLMAP). However, this requirement limits its broader applicability, as Structure-from-Motion (SfM) is often unreliable in sparse-view scenarios where feature matches are limited, resulting in cumulative errors. In this paper, we introduce InstantSplat, a novel and lightning-fast neural reconstruction system that builds accurate 3D representations from as few as 2-3 images. InstantSplat adopts a self-supervised framework that bridges the gap between 2D images and 3D representations using Gaussian Bundle Adjustment (GauBA) and can be optimized in an end-to-end manner. InstantSplat integrates dense stereo priors and co-visibility relationships between frames to initialize pixel-aligned geometry by progressively expanding the scene avoiding redundancy. Gaussian Bundle Adjustment is used to adapt both the scene representation and camera parameters quickly by minimizing gradient-based photometric error. Overall, InstantSplat achieves large-scale 3D reconstruction in mere seconds by reducing the required number of input views. It achieves an acceleration of over 20 times in reconstruction, improves visual quality (SSIM) from 0.3755 to 0.7624 than COLMAP with 3D-GS, and is compatible with multiple 3D representations (3D-GS, 2D-GS, and Mip-Splatting).",

From a research perspective, the problem of mixing touch and vision is underexplored and presents interesting challenges. To this end, we propose Tactile-Informed 3DGS, a novel approach that incorporates touch data (local depth maps) with multi-view vision data to achieve surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Our method optimises 3D Gaussian primitives to accurately model the object's geometry at points of contact. By creating a framework that decreases the transmittance at touch locations, we achieve a refined surface reconstruction, ensuring a uniformly smooth depth map. Touch is particularly useful when considering non-Lambertian objects (e.g. shiny or reflective surfaces) since contemporary methods tend to fail to reconstruct with fidelity specular highlights. By combining vision and tactile sensing, we achieve more accurate geometry reconstructions with fewer images than prior methods. We conduct evaluation on objects with glossy and reflective surfaces and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, offering significant improvements in reconstruction quality.",

    "abstract": "Online dense mapping of urban scenes forms a fundamental cornerstone for scene understanding and navigation of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements in mapping methods are mainly based on NeRF, whose rendering speed is too slow to meet online requirements. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with its rendering speed hundreds of times faster than NeRF, holds greater potential in online dense mapping. However, integrating 3DGS into a street-view dense mapping framework still faces two challenges, including incomplete reconstruction due to the absence of geometric information beyond the LiDAR coverage area and extensive computation for reconstruction in large urban scenes. To this end, we propose HGS-Mapping, an online dense mapping framework in unbounded large-scale scenes. To attain complete construction, our framework introduces Hybrid Gaussian Representation, which models different parts of the entire scene using Gaussians with distinct properties. Furthermore, we employ a hybrid Gaussian initialization mechanism and an adaptive update method to achieve high-fidelity and rapid reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate Gaussian representation into online dense mapping of urban scenes. Our approach achieves SOTA reconstruction accuracy while only employing 66% number of Gaussians, leading to 20% faster reconstruction speed.",

The current mainstream technique to achieve it is neural rendering, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Although thrilling progress has been made, when handling street scenes, current methods struggle to maintain rendering quality at the viewpoint that deviates significantly from the training viewpoints. This issue stems from the sparse training views captured by a fixed camera on a moving vehicle. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach that enhances the capacity of 3DGS by leveraging prior from a Diffusion Model along with complementary multi-modal data. Specifically, we first fine-tune a Diffusion Model by adding images from adjacent frames as condition, meanwhile exploiting depth data from LiDAR point clouds to supply additional spatial information. Then we apply the Diffusion Model to regularize the 3DGS at unseen views during training. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method compared with current state-of-the-art models, and demonstrate its advance in rendering images from broader views.",

However, the previous 3DGS-based methods have limitations in urban scenes due to reliance on initial Structure-from-Motion(SfM) points and difficulties in rendering distant, sky and low-texture areas. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid optimization method named HO-Gaussian, which combines a grid-based volume with the 3DGS pipeline. HO-Gaussian eliminates the dependency on SfM point initialization, allowing for rendering of urban scenes, and incorporates the Point Densitification to enhance rendering quality in problematic regions during training. Furthermore, we introduce Gaussian Direction Encoding as an alternative for spherical harmonics in the rendering pipeline, which enables view-dependent color representation. To account for multi-camera systems, we introduce neural warping to enhance object consistency across different cameras. Experimental results on widely used autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that HO-Gaussian achieves photo-realistic rendering in real-time on multi-camera urban datasets.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a Scale-adaptive method for Anti-aliasing Gaussian Splatting (SA-GS). While the state-of-the-art method Mip-Splatting needs modifying the training procedure of Gaussian splatting, our method functions at test-time and is training-free. Specifically, SA-GS can be applied to any pretrained Gaussian splatting field as a plugin to significantly improve the field's anti-alising performance. The core technique is to apply 2D scale-adaptive filters to each Gaussian during test time. As pointed out by Mip-Splatting, observing Gaussians at different frequencies leads to mismatches between the Gaussian scales during training and testing. Mip-Splatting resolves this issue using 3D smoothing and 2D Mip filters, which are unfortunately not aware of testing frequency. In this work, we show that a 2D scale-adaptive filter that is informed of testing frequency can effectively match the Gaussian scale, thus making the Gaussian primitive distribution remain consistent across different testing frequencies. When scale inconsistency is eliminated, sampling rates smaller than the scene frequency result in conventional jaggedness, and we propose to integrate the projected 2D Gaussian within each pixel during testing. This integration is actually a limiting case of super-sampling, which significantly improves anti-aliasing performance over vanilla Gaussian Splatting. Through extensive experiments using various settings and both bounded and unbounded scenes, we show SA-GS performs comparably with or better than Mip-Splatting. Note that super-sampling and integration are only effective when our scale-adaptive filtering is activated. Our codes, data and models are available at https://github.com/zsy1987/SA-GS.",

It plays a significant role in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases. Improving the rendering quality and speed under sparse sampling is important for observing the status and location of lesions. The current methods exhibit inadequate rendering quality in sparse views and suffer from slow rendering speed. To overcome these limitations, we propose TOGS, a Gaussian splatting method with opacity offset over time, which can effectively improve the rendering quality and speed of 4D DSA. We introduce an opacity offset table for each Gaussian to model the opacity offsets of the Gaussian, using these opacity-varying Gaussians to model the temporal variations in the radiance of the contrast agent. By interpolating the opacity offset table, the opacity variation of the Gaussian at different time points can be determined. This enables us to render the 2D DSA image at that specific moment. Additionally, we introduced a Smooth loss term in the loss function to mitigate overfitting issues that may arise in the model when dealing with sparse view scenarios. During the training phase, we randomly prune Gaussians, thereby reducing the storage overhead of the model. The experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods, this model achieves state-of-the-art render quality under the same number of training views. Additionally, it enables real-time rendering while maintaining low storage overhead. The code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/TOGS.",

Although 3DGS works well for dense input images, the unstructured point-cloud like representation quickly overfits to the more challenging setup of extremely sparse input images (e.g., 3 images), creating a representation that appears as a jumble of needles from novel views. To address this issue, we propose regularized optimization and depth-based initialization. Our key idea is to introduce a structured Gaussian representation that can be controlled in 2D image space. We then constraint the Gaussians, in particular their position, and prevent them from moving independently during optimization. Specifically, we introduce single and multiview constraints through an implicit convolutional decoder and a total variation loss, respectively. With the coherency introduced to the Gaussians, we further constrain the optimization through a flow-based loss function. To support our regularized optimization, we propose an approach to initialize the Gaussians using monocular depth estimates at each input view. We demonstrate significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art sparse-view NeRF-based approaches on a variety of scenes.",

Existing methods for single-image 3D reconstruction are primarily based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with Neural 3D representations. Despite promising results, these approaches encounter practical limitations due to lengthy optimizations and significant memory consumption. In this work, we introduce Gamba, an end-to-end 3D reconstruction model from a single-view image, emphasizing two main insights: (1) Efficient Backbone Design: introducing a Mamba-based GambaFormer network to model 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstruction as sequential prediction with linear scalability of token length, thereby accommodating a substantial number of Gaussians; (2) Robust Gaussian Constraints: deriving radial mask constraints from multi-view masks to eliminate the need for warmup supervision of 3D point clouds in training. We trained Gamba on Objaverse and assessed it against existing optimization-based and feed-forward 3D reconstruction approaches on the GSO Dataset, among which Gamba is the only end-to-end trained single-view reconstruction model with 3DGS. Experimental results demonstrate its competitive generation capabilities both qualitatively and quantitatively and highlight its remarkable speed: Gamba completes reconstruction within 0.05 seconds on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, which is about $1,000\\times$ faster than optimization-based methods.

We incorporate a generic 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) to provide a surface geometric structure, making it possible to reconstruct faces with a limited set of input images. We introduce a joint optimization strategy that refines both the Gaussians and the morphable surface through a synergistic non-rigid alignment process. A novel distance metric, splat-to-surface, is proposed to improve alignment by considering both the Gaussian position and covariance. The surface information is also utilized to incorporate a world-space densification process, resulting in superior reconstruction quality.

To handle the challenge of dynamic objects in ego-centric videos, we design a transient prediction module that learns to filter out dynamic objects in the 3D reconstruction.

This limitation is particularly noticeable in zoom-out views and can lead to inconsistent rendering speeds in scenes with varying details. Moreover, it often struggles to capture the corresponding level of details at different scales with its heuristic density control operation. Inspired by the Level-of-Detail (LOD) techniques, we introduce Octree-GS, featuring an LOD-structured 3D Gaussian approach supporting level-of-detail decomposition for scene representation that contributes to the final rendering results.

We extend 3D Gaussian splatting with depth and normal cues to tackle challenging indoor datasets and showcase techniques for efficient mesh extraction. Specifically, we regularize the optimization procedure with depth information, enforce local smoothness of nearby Gaussians, and use off-the-shelf monocular networks to achieve better alignment with the true scene geometry.

    "abstract": "Presenting a 3D scene from multiview images remains a core and long-standing challenge in computer vision and computer graphics. Two main requirements lie in rendering and reconstruction. Notably, SOTA rendering quality is usually achieved with neural volumetric rendering techniques, which rely on aggregated point/primitive-wise color and neglect the underlying scene geometry. Learning of neural implicit surfaces is sparked from the success of neural rendering. Current works either constrain the distribution of density fields or the shape of primitives, resulting in degraded rendering quality and flaws on the learned scene surfaces. The efficacy of such methods is limited by the inherent constraints of the chosen neural representation, which struggles to capture fine surface details, especially for larger, more intricate scenes. To address these issues, we introduce GSDF, a novel dual-branch architecture that combines the benefits of a flexible and efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation with neural Signed Distance Fields (SDF). The core idea is to leverage and enhance the strengths of each branch while alleviating their limitation through mutual guidance and joint supervision.

The photometric variation and transient occluders in those unconstrained images make it difficult to reconstruct the original scene accurately. Previous approaches tackle the problem by introducing a global appearance feature in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, in the real world, the unique appearance of each tiny point in a scene is determined by its independent intrinsic material attributes and the varying environmental impacts it receives. Inspired by this fact, we propose Gaussian in the wild (GS-W), a method that uses 3D Gaussian points to reconstruct the scene and introduces separated intrinsic and dynamic appearance feature for each point, capturing the unchanged scene appearance along with dynamic variation like illumination and weather. Additionally, an adaptive sampling strategy is presented to allow each Gaussian point to focus on the local and detailed information more effectively. We also reduce the impact of transient occluders using a 2D visibility map. More experiments have demonstrated better reconstruction quality and details of GS-W compared to NeRF-based methods, with a faster rendering speed.

We further build a 3D semantic network that directly predicts the semantic component from raw 3D Gaussians for fast inference. The quantitative results on ScanNet segmentation and LERF object localization demonstates the superior performance of our method.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis results while advancing real-time rendering performance. However, it relies heavily on the quality of the initial point cloud, resulting in blurring and needle-like artifacts in areas with insufficient initializing points. This is mainly attributed to the point cloud growth condition in 3DGS that only considers the average gradient magnitude of points from observable views, thereby failing to grow for large Gaussians that are observable for many viewpoints while many of them are only covered in the boundaries. To this end, we propose a novel method, named Pixel-GS, to take into account the number of pixels covered by the Gaussian in each view during the computation of the growth condition. We regard the covered pixel numbers as the weights to dynamically average the gradients from different views, such that the growth of large Gaussians can be prompted. As a result, points within the areas with insufficient initializing points can be grown more effectively, leading to a more accurate and detailed reconstruction. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to scale the gradient field according to the distance to the camera, to suppress the growth of floaters near the camera. Extensive experiments both qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed, on the challenging Mip-NeRF 360 and Tanks & Temples datasets.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in pre-trained diffusion models and 3D generation have spurred interest in 4D content creation. However, achieving high-fidelity 4D generation with spatial-temporal consistency remains a challenge. In this work, we propose STAG4D, a novel framework that combines pre-trained diffusion models with dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting for high-fidelity 4D generation. Drawing inspiration from 3D generation techniques, we utilize a multi-view diffusion model to initialize multi-view images anchoring on the input video frames, where the video can be either real-world captured or generated by a video diffusion model. To ensure the temporal consistency of the multi-view sequence initialization, we introduce a simple yet effective fusion strategy to leverage the first frame as a temporal anchor in the self-attention computation. With the almost consistent multi-view sequences, we then apply the score distillation sampling to optimize the 4D Gaussian point cloud. The 4D Gaussian spatting is specially crafted for the generation task, where an adaptive densification strategy is proposed to mitigate the unstable Gaussian gradient for robust optimization. Notably, the proposed pipeline does not require any pre-training or fine-tuning of diffusion networks, offering a more accessible and practical solution for the 4D generation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prior 4D generation works in rendering quality, spatial-temporal consistency, and generation robustness, setting a new state-of-the-art for 4D generation from diverse inputs, including text, image, and video.",

    "abstract": "We propose Gaussian Frosting, a novel mesh-based representation for high-quality rendering and editing of complex 3D effects in real-time. Our approach builds on the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, which optimizes a set of 3D Gaussians to approximate a radiance field from images. We propose first extracting a base mesh from Gaussians during optimization, then building and refining an adaptive layer of Gaussians with a variable thickness around the mesh to better capture the fine details and volumetric effects near the surface, such as hair or grass. We call this layer Gaussian Frosting, as it resembles a coating of frosting on a cake. The fuzzier the material, the thicker the frosting. We also introduce a parameterization of the Gaussians to enforce them to stay inside the frosting layer and automatically adjust their parameters when deforming, rescaling, editing or animating the mesh. Our representation allows for efficient rendering using Gaussian splatting, as well as editing and animation by modifying the base mesh. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various synthetic and real scenes, and show that it outperforms existing surface-based approaches. We will release our code and a web-based viewer as additional contributions. Our project page is the following: https://anttwo.github.io/frosting/",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising framework for novel view synthesis, boasting rapid rendering speed with high fidelity. However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To address this, we make use of the relations between the unorganized anchors and the structured hash grid, leveraging their mutual information for context modeling, and propose a Hash-grid Assisted Context (HAC) framework for highly compact 3DGS representation. Our approach introduces a binary hash grid to establish continuous spatial consistencies, allowing us to unveil the inherent spatial relations of anchors through a carefully designed context model. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to accurately estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Importantly, our work is the pioneer to explore context-based compression for 3DGS representation, resulting in a remarkable size reduction of over $75\\times$ compared to vanilla 3DGS, while simultaneously improving fidelity, and achieving over $11\\times$ size reduction over SOTA 3DGS compression approach Scaffold-GS.

While Radiance Field-based methods achieve state-of-the-art quality in challenging scenarios such as in-the-wild captures and large-scale scenes, they often suffer from excessively high compute requirements linked to volumetric rendering. Gaussian Splatting-based methods, on the other hand, rely on rasterization and naturally achieve real-time rendering but suffer from brittle optimization heuristics that underperform on more challenging scenes. In this work, we present RadSplat, a lightweight method for robust real-time rendering of complex scenes. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we use radiance fields as a prior and supervision signal for optimizing point-based scene representations, leading to improved quality and more robust optimization. Next, we develop a novel pruning technique reducing the overall point count while maintaining high quality, leading to smaller and more compact scene representations with faster inference speeds. Finally, we propose a novel test-time filtering approach that further accelerates rendering and allows to scale to larger, house-sized scenes. We find that our method enables state-of-the-art synthesis of complex captures at 900+ FPS.",

To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces a novel diffusion-based framework, GVGEN, designed to efficiently generate 3D Gaussian representations from text input. We propose two innovative techniques:(1) Structured Volumetric Representation. We first arrange disorganized 3D Gaussian points as a structured form GaussianVolume. This transformation allows the capture of intricate texture details within a volume composed of a fixed number of Gaussians. To better optimize the representation of these details, we propose a unique pruning and densifying method named the Candidate Pool Strategy, enhancing detail fidelity through selective optimization. (2) Coarse-to-fine Generation Pipeline. To simplify the generation of GaussianVolume and empower the model to generate instances with detailed 3D geometry, we propose a coarse-to-fine pipeline. It initially constructs a basic geometric structure, followed by the prediction of complete Gaussian attributes. Our framework, GVGEN, demonstrates superior performance in qualitative and quantitative assessments compared to existing 3D generation methods. Simultaneously, it maintains a fast generation speed ($\\sim$7 seconds), effectively striking a balance between quality and efficiency. Our project page is: https://gvgen.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Holistic understanding of urban scenes based on RGB images is a challenging yet important problem. It encompasses understanding both the geometry and appearance to enable novel view synthesis, parsing semantic labels, and tracking moving objects. Despite considerable progress, existing approaches often focus on specific aspects of this task and require additional inputs such as LiDAR scans or manually annotated 3D bounding boxes. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for holistic urban scene understanding. Our main idea involves the joint optimization of geometry, appearance, semantics, and motion using a combination of static and dynamic 3D Gaussians, where moving object poses are regularized via physical constraints. Our approach offers the ability to render new viewpoints in real-time, yielding 2D and 3D semantic information with high accuracy, and reconstruct dynamic scenes, even in scenarios where 3D bounding box detection are highly noisy. Experimental results on KITTI, KITTI-360, and Virtual KITTI 2 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

In this paper, we propose a novel dense representation SLAM approach with a fusion of Generalized Iterative Closest Point (G-ICP) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

    "abstract": "Creating 4D fields of Gaussian Splatting from images or videos is a challenging task due to its under-constrained nature. While the optimization can draw photometric reference from the input videos or be regulated by generative models, directly supervising Gaussian motions remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept, Gaussian flow, which connects the dynamics of 3D Gaussians and pixel velocities between consecutive frames. The Gaussian flow can be efficiently obtained by splatting Gaussian dynamics into the image space. This differentiable process enables direct dynamic supervision from optical flow. Our method significantly benefits 4D dynamic content generation and 4D novel view synthesis with Gaussian Splatting, especially for contents with rich motions that are hard to be handled by existing methods. The common color drifting issue that happens in 4D generation is also resolved with improved Guassian dynamics. Superior visual quality on extensive experiments demonstrates our method's effectiveness. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both tasks of 4D generation and 4D novel view synthesis.

    "abstract": "Generating multi-view images based on text or single-image prompts is a critical capability for the creation of 3D content. Two fundamental questions on this topic are what data we use for training and how to ensure multi-view consistency. This paper introduces a novel framework that makes fundamental contributions to both questions. Unlike leveraging images from 2D diffusion models for training, we propose a dense consistent multi-view generation model that is fine-tuned from off-the-shelf video generative models. Images from video generative models are more suitable for multi-view generation because the underlying network architecture that generates them employs a temporal module to enforce frame consistency. Moreover, the video data sets used to train these models are abundant and diverse, leading to a reduced train-finetuning domain gap. To enhance multi-view consistency, we introduce a 3D-Aware Denoising Sampling, which first employs a feed-forward reconstruction module to get an explicit global 3D model, and then adopts a sampling strategy that effectively involves images rendered from the global 3D model into the denoising sampling loop to improve the multi-view consistency of the final images. As a by-product, this module also provides a fast way to create 3D assets represented by 3D Gaussians within a few seconds. Our approach can generate 24 dense views and converges much faster in training than state-of-the-art approaches (4 GPU hours versus many thousand GPU hours) with comparable visual quality and consistency. By further fine-tuning, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual effects. Our project page is aigc3d.github.io/VideoMV.",

    "abstract": "An excellent representation is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL) performance, especially in vision-based reinforcement learning tasks. The quality of the environment representation directly influences the achievement of the learning task. Previous vision-based RL typically uses explicit or implicit ways to represent environments, such as images, points, voxels, and neural radiance fields. However, these representations contain several drawbacks. They cannot either describe complex local geometries or generalize well to unseen scenes, or require precise foreground masks. Moreover, these implicit neural representations are akin to a ``black box\", significantly hindering interpretability. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with its explicit scene representation and differentiable rendering nature, is considered a revolutionary change for reconstruction and representation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework to be the representation of RL tasks, called GSRL. Through validation in the RoboMimic environment, our method achieves better results than other baselines in multiple tasks, improving the performance by 10%, 44%, and 15% compared with baselines on the hardest task. This work is the first attempt to leverage generalizable 3DGS as a representation for RL.",

Currently, diffusion-based 2D editing models are harnessed to modify multi-view rendered images, which then guide the editing of 3DGS models. However, this approach faces a critical issue of multi-view inconsistency, where the guidance images exhibit significant discrepancies across views, leading to mode collapse and visual artifacts of 3DGS. To this end, we introduce View-consistent Editing (VcEdit), a novel framework that seamlessly incorporates 3DGS into image editing processes, ensuring multi-view consistency in edited guidance images and effectively mitigating mode collapse issues. VcEdit employs two innovative consistency modules: the Cross-attention Consistency Module and the Editing Consistency Module, both designed to reduce inconsistencies in edited images. By incorporating these consistency modules into an iterative pattern, VcEdit proficiently resolves the issue of multi-view inconsistency, facilitating high-quality 3DGS editing across a diverse range of scenes.

    "abstract": "While neural rendering has demonstrated impressive capabilities in 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, it heavily relies on high-quality sharp images and accurate camera poses. Numerous approaches have been proposed to train Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with motion-blurred images, commonly encountered in real-world scenarios such as low-light or long-exposure conditions. However, the implicit representation of NeRF struggles to accurately recover intricate details from severely motion-blurred images and cannot achieve real-time rendering. In contrast, recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction and real-time rendering by explicitly optimizing point clouds as Gaussian spheres.   In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, named BAD-Gaussians (Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting), which leverages explicit Gaussian representation and handles severe motion-blurred images with inaccurate camera poses to achieve high-quality scene reconstruction. Our method models the physical image formation process of motion-blurred images and jointly learns the parameters of Gaussians while recovering camera motion trajectories during exposure time.   In our experiments, we demonstrate that BAD-Gaussians not only achieves superior rendering quality compared to previous state-of-the-art deblur neural rendering methods on both synthetic and real datasets but also enables real-time rendering capabilities.

The primary challenge of IIN arises from the need to recognize the target object across varying viewpoints while ignoring potential distractors. Existing map-based navigation methods typically use Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps, which lack detailed texture representation of a scene. Consequently, while BEV maps are effective for semantic-level visual navigation, they are struggling for instance-level tasks. To this end, we propose a new framework for IIN, Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation (GaussNav), which constructs a novel map representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The GaussNav framework enables the agent to memorize both the geometry and semantic information of the scene, as well as retain the textural features of objects. By matching renderings of similar objects with the target, the agent can accurately identify, ground, and navigate to the specified object. Our GaussNav framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement, with Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) increasing from 0.347 to 0.578 on the challenging Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset.

While existing NeRF-based methods can achieve high-quality novel view rendering of human models, both training and inference processes are time-consuming. Recent approaches have utilized 3D Gaussians to represent the human body, enabling faster training and rendering. However, they undermine the importance of the mesh guidance and directly predict Gaussians in 3D space with coarse mesh guidance. This hinders the learning procedure of the Gaussians and tends to produce blurry textures. Therefore, we propose UV Gaussians, which models the 3D human body by jointly learning mesh deformations and 2D UV-space Gaussian textures. We utilize the embedding of UV map to learn Gaussian textures in 2D space, leveraging the capabilities of powerful 2D networks to extract features. Additionally, through an independent Mesh network, we optimize pose-dependent geometric deformations, thereby guiding Gaussian rendering and significantly enhancing rendering quality. We collect and process a new dataset of human motion, which includes multi-view images, scanned models, parametric model registration, and corresponding texture maps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art synthesis of novel view and novel pose.

The approach hampers scalability because it places a heavy load on the server and demands extensive data storage when reconstructing scenes on a scale beyond city-scale. In pursuit of a more scalable 3D reconstruction, we propose a federated learning framework with 3DGS, which is a decentralized framework and can potentially use distributed computational resources across millions of clients. We tailor a distillation-based model update scheme for 3DGS and introduce appearance modeling for handling non-IID data in the scenario of 3D reconstruction with federated learning. We simulate our method on several large-scale benchmarks, and our method demonstrates rendered image quality comparable to centralized approaches. In addition, we also simulate our method with data collected in different seasons, demonstrating that our framework can reflect changes in the scenes and our appearance modeling captures changes due to seasonal variations.",

    "abstract": "This is only a preview version of GauMesh. Recently, primitive-based rendering has been proven to achieve convincing results in solving the problem of modeling and rendering the 3D dynamic scene from 2D images. Despite this, in the context of novel view synthesis, each type of primitive has its inherent defects in terms of representation ability. It is difficult to exploit the mesh to depict the fuzzy geometry. Meanwhile, the point-based splatting (e.g. the 3D Gaussian Splatting) method usually produces artifacts or blurry pixels in the area with smooth geometry and sharp textures. As a result, it is difficult, even not impossible, to represent the complex and dynamic scene with a single type of primitive. To this end, we propose a novel approach, GauMesh, to bridge the 3D Gaussian and Mesh for modeling and rendering the dynamic scenes. Given a sequence of tracked mesh as initialization, our goal is to simultaneously optimize the mesh geometry, color texture, opacity maps, a set of 3D Gaussians, and the deformation field. At a specific time, we perform $\\alpha$-blending on the RGB and opacity values based on the merged and re-ordered z-buffers from mesh and 3D Gaussian rasterizations. This produces the final rendering, which is supervised by the ground-truth image. Experiments demonstrate that our approach adapts the appropriate type of primitives to represent the different parts of the dynamic scene and outperforms all the baseline methods in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons without losing render speed.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become an emerging tool for dynamic scene reconstruction. However, existing methods focus mainly on extending static 3DGS into a time-variant representation, while overlooking the rich motion information carried by 2D observations, thus suffering from performance degradation and model redundancy. To address the above problem, we propose a novel motion-aware enhancement framework for dynamic scene reconstruction, which mines useful motion cues from optical flow to improve different paradigms of dynamic 3DGS. Specifically, we first establish a correspondence between 3D Gaussian movements and pixel-level flow. Then a novel flow augmentation method is introduced with additional insights into uncertainty and loss collaboration. Moreover, for the prevalent deformation-based paradigm that presents a harder optimization problem, a transient-aware deformation auxiliary module is proposed. We conduct extensive experiments on both multi-view and monocular scenes to verify the merits of our work. Compared with the baselines, our method shows significant superiority in both rendering quality and efficiency.",

Recently, some studies have successfully constructed animatable 3D models from monocular videos.

This limitation restricts the practical applications. In this work, we propose a method to build animatable 3D Gaussian Splatting from monocular video with diffusion priors. The 3D Gaussian representations significantly accelerate the training and rendering process, and the diffusion priors allow the method to learn 3D models with limited viewpoints.

To mitigate excessive GPU memory usage and facilitate rapid spatial queries, we employ a combination of a 2D voxel map and a KD-tree. This preparation makes our method well-suited for visual localization tasks, enabling efficient identification of correspondences between the query image and the rendered image from the Gaussian Splatting map via normalized cross-correlation (NCC). Additionally, we refine the camera pose of the query image using feature-based matching and the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. The effectiveness, adaptability, and precision of our system are demonstrated through extensive evaluation on the KITTI360 dataset.",

    "abstract": "It is desirable to create 3D object models and 3D maps from 2D input images for applications such as navigation, virtual tourism, and urban planning. The traditional methods of creating 3D maps, (such as photogrammetry), require a large number of images and odometry. Additionally, traditional methods have difficulty with reflective surfaces and specular reflections; windows and chrome in the scene can be problematic. Google Road View is a familiar application, which uses traditional methods to fuse a collection of 2D input images into the illusion of a 3D map. However, Google Road View does not create an actual 3D object model, only a collection of views. The objective of this work is to create an actual 3D object model using updated techniques. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF[1]) has emerged as a potential solution, offering the capability to produce more precise and intricate 3D maps. Gaussian Splatting[4] is another contemporary technique. This investigation compares Neural Radiance Fields to Gaussian Splatting, and describes some of their inner workings. Our primary contribution is a method for improving the results of the 3D reconstructed models. Our results indicate that Gaussian Splatting was superior to the NeRF technique.",

This degradation significantly affects the rendering quality of novel views that deviate significantly from the viewpoints in the training data. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel approach called GeoGaussian. Based on the smoothly connected areas observed from point clouds, this method introduces a novel pipeline to initialize thin Gaussians aligned with the surfaces, where the characteristic can be transferred to new generations through a carefully designed densification strategy. Finally, the pipeline ensures that the scene's geometry and texture are maintained through constrained optimization processes with explicit geometry constraints. Benefiting from the proposed architecture, the generative ability of 3D Gaussians is enhanced, especially in structured regions. Our proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and geometric reconstruction, as evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on public datasets.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image priors with 3D representation methods, e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to feed-forward generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. An obstacle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end feed-forward approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the spatial feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts. The code is available in the project page.",

However, these approaches are built on a tremendous number of redundant 3D Gaussian ellipsoids, leading to high memory and storage costs, and slow training speed. To address the limitation, we propose a compact 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that reduces the number and the parameter size of Gaussian ellipsoids. A sliding window-based masking strategy is first proposed to reduce the redundant ellipsoids. Then we observe that the covariance matrix (geometry) of most 3D Gaussian ellipsoids are extremely similar, which motivates a novel geometry codebook to compress 3D Gaussian geometric attributes, i.e., the parameters. Robust and accurate pose estimation is achieved by a global bundle adjustment method with reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster training and rendering speed while maintaining the state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality of the scene representation.",

    "abstract": "The 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gained its popularity recently by combining the advantages of both primitive-based and volumetric 3D representations, resulting in improved quality and efficiency for 3D scene rendering. However, 3DGS is not alias-free, and its rendering at varying resolutions could produce severe blurring or jaggies. This is because 3DGS treats each pixel as an isolated, single point rather than as an area, causing insensitivity to changes in the footprints of pixels. Consequently, this discrete sampling scheme inevitably results in aliasing, owing to the restricted sampling bandwidth. In this paper, we derive an analytical solution to address this issue. More specifically, we use a conditioned logistic function as the analytic approximation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) in a one-dimensional Gaussian signal and calculate the Gaussian integral by subtracting the CDFs. We then introduce this approximation in the two-dimensional pixel shading, and present Analytic-Splatting, which analytically approximates the Gaussian integral within the 2D-pixel window area to better capture the intensity response of each pixel. Moreover, we use the approximated response of the pixel window integral area to participate in the transmittance calculation of volume rendering, making Analytic-Splatting sensitive to the changes in pixel footprint at different resolutions. Experiments on various datasets validate that our approach has better anti-aliasing capability that gives more details and better fidelity.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents GGRt, a novel approach to generalizable novel view synthesis that alleviates the need for real camera poses, complexity in processing high-resolution images, and lengthy optimization processes, thus facilitating stronger applicability of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we design a novel joint learning framework that consists of an Iterative Pose Optimization Network (IPO-Net) and a Generalizable 3D-Gaussians (G-3DG) model. With the joint learning mechanism, the proposed framework can inherently estimate robust relative pose information from the image observations and thus primarily alleviate the requirement of real camera poses. Moreover, we implement a deferred back-propagation mechanism that enables high-resolution training and inference, overcoming the resolution constraints of previous methods. To enhance the speed and efficiency, we further introduce a progressive Gaussian cache module that dynamically adjusts during training and inference. As the first pose-free generalizable 3D-GS framework, GGRt achieves inference at $\\ge$ 5 FPS and real-time rendering at $\\ge$ 100 FPS. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing NeRF-based pose-free techniques in terms of inference speed and effectiveness. It can also approach the real pose-based 3D-GS methods. Our contributions provide a significant leap forward for the integration of computer vision and computer graphics into practical applications, offering state-of-the-art results on LLFF, KITTI, and Waymo Open datasets and enabling real-time rendering for immersive experiences.",

However, it couples the appearance and geometry of the scene within the Gaussian attributes, which hinders the flexibility of editing operations, such as texture swapping. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, namely Texture-GS, to disentangle the appearance from the geometry by representing it as a 2D texture mapped onto the 3D surface, thereby facilitating appearance editing. Technically, the disentanglement is achieved by our proposed texture mapping module, which consists of a UV mapping MLP to learn the UV coordinates for the 3D Gaussian centers, a local Taylor expansion of the MLP to efficiently approximate the UV coordinates for the ray-Gaussian intersections, and a learnable texture to capture the fine-grained appearance. Extensive experiments on the DTU dataset demonstrate that our method not only facilitates high-fidelity appearance editing but also achieves real-time rendering on consumer-level devices, e.g. a single RTX 2080 Ti GPU.",

To address this task, 1) we introduce Multi-view ControlNet (MVControl), a novel neural network architecture designed to enhance existing pre-trained multi-view diffusion models by integrating additional input conditions, such as edge, depth, normal, and scribble maps. Our innovation lies in the introduction of a conditioning module that controls the base diffusion model using both local and global embeddings, which are computed from the input condition images and camera poses. Once trained, MVControl is able to offer 3D diffusion guidance for optimization-based 3D generation. And, 2) we propose an efficient multi-stage 3D generation pipeline that leverages the benefits of recent large reconstruction models and score distillation algorithm. Building upon our MVControl architecture, we employ a unique hybrid diffusion guidance method to direct the optimization process. In pursuit of efficiency, we adopt 3D Gaussians as our representation instead of the commonly used implicit representations. We also pioneer the use of SuGaR, a hybrid representation that binds Gaussians to mesh triangle faces. This approach alleviates the issue of poor geometry in 3D Gaussians and enables the direct sculpting of fine-grained geometry on the mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization and enables the controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.",

Our aim is to contribute to the development of popular 3D scene reconstruction algorithms such as IBRnet, NeRF, and 3D Gaussian splitting. More importantly, the collected dataset, which is much denser than existing datasets, may also inspire space-oriented light field reconstruction, which is potentially different from object-centric 3D reconstruction, for immersive VR/AR experiences. We utilized a total of 40 GoPro 10 cameras, capturing images of 5k resolution. The number of photos captured for each scene is no less than 1000, and the average density (view number within a unit sphere) is 134.68. It is also worth noting that our system is capable of efficiently capturing large outdoor scenes. Addressing the current lack of large-space and dense light field datasets, we made efforts to include elements such as sky, reflections, lights and shadows that are of interest to researchers in the field of 3D reconstruction during the data capture process. Finally, we validated the effectiveness of our provided dataset on three popular algorithms and also integrated the reconstructed 3DGS results into the Unity engine, demonstrating the potential of utilizing our datasets to enhance the realism of virtual reality (VR) and create feasible interactive spaces.

Optical tactile sensors have become widespread in their use in robotics for manipulation and object representation; however, raw optical tactile sensor data is unsuitable to directly supervise a 3DGS scene. Our representation leverages a Gaussian Process Implicit Surface to implicitly represent the object, combining many touches into a unified representation with uncertainty. We merge this model with a monocular depth estimation network, which is aligned in a two stage process, coarsely aligning with a depth camera and then finely adjusting to match our touch data. For every training image, our method produces a corresponding fused depth and uncertainty map. Utilizing this additional information, we propose a new loss function, variance weighted depth supervised loss, for training the 3DGS scene model. We leverage the DenseTact optical tactile sensor and RealSense RGB-D camera to show that combining touch and vision in this manner leads to quantitatively and qualitatively better results than vision or touch alone in a few-view scene syntheses on opaque as well as on reflective and transparent objects.

    "abstract": "Constructing a 3D scene capable of accommodating open-ended language queries, is a pivotal pursuit, particularly within the domain of robotics. Such technology facilitates robots in executing object manipulations based on human language directives. To tackle this challenge, some research efforts have been dedicated to the development of language-embedded implicit fields. However, implicit fields (e.g. NeRF) encounter limitations due to the necessity of processing a large number of input views for reconstruction, coupled with their inherent inefficiencies in inference. Thus, we present the GaussianGrasper, which utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to explicitly represent the scene as a collection of Gaussian primitives. Our approach takes a limited set of RGB-D views and employs a tile-based splatting technique to create a feature field. In particular, we propose an Efficient Feature Distillation (EFD) module that employs contrastive learning to efficiently and accurately distill language embeddings derived from foundational models. With the reconstructed geometry of the Gaussian field, our method enables the pre-trained grasping model to generate collision-free grasp pose candidates. Furthermore, we propose a normal-guided grasp module to select the best grasp pose. Through comprehensive real-world experiments, we demonstrate that GaussianGrasper enables robots to accurately query and grasp objects with language instructions, providing a new solution for language-guided manipulation tasks.

However, 3DGS heavily depends on the accurate initialization derived from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods. When the quality of the initial point cloud deteriorates, such as in the presence of noise or when using randomly initialized point cloud, 3DGS often undergoes large performance drops. To address this limitation, we propose a novel optimization strategy dubbed RAIN-GS (Relaing Accurate Initialization Constraint for 3D Gaussian Splatting). Our approach is based on an in-depth analysis of the original 3DGS optimization scheme and the analysis of the SfM initialization in the frequency domain. Leveraging simple modifications based on our analyses, RAIN-GS successfully trains 3D Gaussians from sub-optimal point cloud (e.g., randomly initialized point cloud), effectively relaxing the need for accurate initialization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our strategy through quantitative and qualitative comparisons on multiple datasets, where RAIN-GS trained with random point cloud achieves performance on-par with or even better than 3DGS trained with accurate SfM point cloud.

In this work, we propose a method named ``3D Gaussian Generation via Hypergraph (Hyper-3DG)'', designed to capture the sophisticated high-order correlations present within 3D objects. Our framework is anchored by a well-established mainflow and an essential module, named ``Geometry and Texture Hypergraph Refiner (HGRefiner)''. This module not only refines the representation of 3D Gaussians but also accelerates the update process of these 3D Gaussians by conducting the Patch-3DGS Hypergraph Learning on both explicit attributes and latent visual features. Our framework allows for the production of finely generated 3D objects within a cohesive optimization, effectively circumventing degradation. Extensive experimentation has shown that our proposed method significantly enhances the quality of 3D generation while incurring no additional computational overhead for the underlying framework.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting models, as a novel explicit 3D representation, have been applied in many domains recently, such as explicit geometric editing and geometry generation. Progress has been rapid. However, due to their mixed scales and cluttered shapes, 3D Gaussian splatting models can produce a blurred or needle-like effect near the surface. At the same time, 3D Gaussian splatting models tend to flatten large untextured regions, yielding a very sparse point cloud. These problems are caused by the non-uniform nature of 3D Gaussian splatting models, so in this paper, we propose a new 3D Gaussian splitting algorithm, which can produce a more uniform and surface-bounded 3D Gaussian splatting model. Our algorithm splits an $N$-dimensional Gaussian into two N-dimensional Gaussians. It ensures consistency of mathematical characteristics and similarity of appearance, allowing resulting 3D Gaussian splatting models to be more uniform and a better fit to the underlying surface, and thus more suitable for explicit editing, point cloud extraction and other tasks. Meanwhile, our 3D Gaussian splitting approach has a very simple closed-form solution, making it readily applicable to any 3D Gaussian model.",

Our key contribution is multi-view consistent editing, which enables editing all images together instead of iteratively editing one image while updating the 3D model as in previous works.   It leads to faster editing as well as higher visual quality.   This is achieved by the two terms:   (a) depth-conditioned editing that enforces geometric consistency across multi-view images by leveraging naturally consistent depth maps.   (b) attention-based latent code alignment that unifies the appearance of edited images by conditioning their editing to several reference views through self and cross-view attention between images' latent representations.

However, this requirement often hinders their use on low-end devices with limited memory. In response, we propose a groundbreaking paradigm of image representation and compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting, named GaussianImage. We first introduce 2D Gaussian to represent the image, where each Gaussian has 8 parameters including position, covariance and color. Subsequently, we unveil a novel rendering algorithm based on accumulated summation. Remarkably, our method with a minimum of 3$\\times$ lower GPU memory usage and 5$\\times$ faster fitting time not only rivals INRs (e.g., WIRE, I-NGP) in representation performance, but also delivers a faster rendering speed of 1500-2000 FPS regardless of parameter size. Furthermore, we integrate existing vector quantization technique to build an image codec. Experimental results demonstrate that our codec attains rate-distortion performance comparable to compression-based INRs such as COIN and COIN++, while facilitating decoding speeds of approximately 2000 FPS. Additionally, preliminary proof of concept shows that our codec surpasses COIN and COIN++ in performance when using partial bits-back coding.

    "abstract": "3D scene stylization extends the work of neural style transfer to 3D. A vital challenge in this problem is to maintain the uniformity of the stylized appearance across multiple views. A vast majority of the previous works achieve this by training a 3D model for every stylized image and a set of multi-view images. In contrast, we propose a novel architecture trained on a collection of style images that, at test time, produces real time high-quality stylized novel views. We choose the underlying 3D scene representation for our model as 3D Gaussian splatting. We take the 3D Gaussians and process them using a multi-resolution hash grid and a tiny MLP to obtain stylized views. The MLP is conditioned on different style codes for generalization to different styles during test time. The explicit nature of 3D Gaussians gives us inherent advantages over NeRF-based methods, including geometric consistency and a fast training and rendering regime. This enables our method to be useful for various practical use cases, such as augmented or virtual reality. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior visual quality on various indoor and outdoor real-world data.",

    "abstract": "We introduce StyleGaussian, a novel 3D style transfer technique that allows instant transfer of any image's style to a 3D scene at 10 frames per second (fps). Leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), StyleGaussian achieves style transfer without compromising its real-time rendering ability and multi-view consistency. It achieves instant style transfer with three steps: embedding, transfer, and decoding. Initially, 2D VGG scene features are embedded into reconstructed 3D Gaussians. Next, the embedded features are transformed according to a reference style image. Finally, the transformed features are decoded into the stylized RGB. StyleGaussian has two novel designs. The first is an efficient feature rendering strategy that first renders low-dimensional features and then maps them into high-dimensional features while embedding VGG features. It cuts the memory consumption significantly and enables 3DGS to render the high-dimensional memory-intensive features. The second is a K-nearest-neighbor-based 3D CNN. Working as the decoder for the stylized features, it eliminates the 2D CNN operations that compromise strict multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments show that StyleGaussian achieves instant 3D stylization with superior stylization quality while preserving real-time rendering and strict multi-view consistency.

This paper introduces DNGaussian, a depth-regularized framework based on 3D Gaussian radiance fields, offering real-time and high-quality few-shot novel view synthesis at low costs. Our motivation stems from the highly efficient representation and surprising quality of the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting, despite it will encounter a geometry degradation when input views decrease. In the Gaussian radiance fields, we find this degradation in scene geometry primarily lined to the positioning of Gaussian primitives and can be mitigated by depth constraint. Consequently, we propose a Hard and Soft Depth Regularization to restore accurate scene geometry under coarse monocular depth supervision while maintaining a fine-grained color appearance. To further refine detailed geometry reshaping, we introduce Global-Local Depth Normalization, enhancing the focus on small local depth changes. Extensive experiments on LLFF, DTU, and Blender datasets demonstrate that DNGaussian outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving comparable or better results with significantly reduced memory cost, a $25 \\times$ reduction in training time, and over $3000 \\times$ faster rendering speed.",

However, it often suffers from over-reconstruction during Gaussian densification where high-variance image regions are covered by a few large Gaussians only, leading to blur and artifacts in the rendered images. We design a progressive frequency regularization (FreGS) technique to tackle the over-reconstruction issue within the frequency space. Specifically, FreGS performs coarse-to-fine Gaussian densification by exploiting low-to-high frequency components that can be easily extracted with low-pass and high-pass filters in the Fourier space. By minimizing the discrepancy between the frequency spectrum of the rendered image and the corresponding ground truth, it achieves high-quality Gaussian densification and alleviates the over-reconstruction of Gaussian splatting effectively. Experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks (e.g., Mip-NeRF360, Tanks-and-Temples and Deep Blending) show that FreGS achieves superior novel view synthesis and outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently.",

In this work, we analyze the robustness of Gaussian-Splatting-based methods against various image blur, such as motion blur, defocus blur, downscaling blur, \\etc. Under these degradations, Gaussian-Splatting-based methods tend to overfit and produce worse results than Neural-Radiance-Field-based methods. To address this issue, we propose Blur Agnostic Gaussian Splatting (BAGS). BAGS introduces additional 2D modeling capacities such that a 3D-consistent and high quality scene can be reconstructed despite image-wise blur. Specifically, we model blur by estimating per-pixel convolution kernels from a Blur Proposal Network (BPN). BPN is designed to consider spatial, color, and depth variations of the scene to maximize modeling capacity. Additionally, BPN also proposes a quality-assessing mask, which indicates regions where blur occur. Finally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine kernel optimization scheme; this optimization scheme is fast and avoids sub-optimal solutions due to a sparse point cloud initialization, which often occurs when we apply Structure-from-Motion on blurry images. We demonstrate that BAGS achieves photorealistic renderings under various challenging blur conditions and imaging geometry, while significantly improving upon existing approaches.",

When rendering novel view X-ray projections, existing methods mainly based on NeRF suffer from long training time and slow inference speed. In this paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework, namely X-Gaussian, for X-ray novel view synthesis. Firstly, we redesign a radiative Gaussian point cloud model inspired by the isotropic nature of X-ray imaging. Our model excludes the influence of view direction when learning to predict the radiation intensity of 3D points. Based on this model, we develop a Differentiable Radiative Rasterization (DRR) with CUDA implementation. Secondly, we customize an Angle-pose Cuboid Uniform Initialization (ACUI) strategy that directly uses the parameters of the X-ray scanner to compute the camera information and then uniformly samples point positions within a cuboid enclosing the scanned object. Experiments show that our X-Gaussian outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 6.5 dB while enjoying less than 15% training time and over 73x inference speed. The application on sparse-view CT reconstruction also reveals the practical values of our method. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/X-Gaussian .

This combination effectively guides photon emission in expansive 3D scenes with multiple light sources. By employing a global 3D Gaussian mixture, our method precisely models the distribution of the points of interest. To sample emission directions from the distribution at any observation point, we introduce a novel directional transform of the 3D Gaussian, which ensures accurate photon emission guiding. Furthermore, our method integrates a global light cluster tree, which models the contribution distribution of light sources to the image, facilitating effective light source selection.

    "abstract": "We present Splat-Nav, a real-time robot navigation pipeline for Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) scenes, a powerful new 3D scene representation. Splat-Nav consists of two components: 1) Splat-Plan, a safe planning module, and 2) Splat-Loc, a robust vision-based pose estimation module. Splat-Plan builds a safe-by-construction polytope corridor through the map based on mathematically rigorous collision constraints and then constructs a B\\'ezier curve trajectory through this corridor. Splat-Loc provides real-time recursive state estimates given only an RGB feed from an on-board camera, leveraging the point-cloud representation inherent in GSplat scenes. Working together, these modules give robots the ability to recursively re-plan smooth and safe trajectories to goal locations. Goals can be specified with position coordinates, or with language commands by using a semantic GSplat. We demonstrate improved safety compared to point cloud-based methods in extensive simulation experiments. In a total of 126 hardware flights, we demonstrate equivalent safety and speed compared to motion capture and visual odometry, but without a manual frame alignment required by those methods. We show online re-planning at more than 2 Hz and pose estimation at about 25 Hz, an order of magnitude faster than Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based navigation methods, thereby enabling real-time navigation.

Despite the remarkable advancements achieved by current neural rendering techniques, these methods generally require complete video sequences for offline training and are not capable of real-time rendering. To address these constraints, we introduce 3DGStream, a method designed for efficient FVV streaming of real-world dynamic scenes. Our method achieves fast on-the-fly per-frame reconstruction within 12 seconds and real-time rendering at 200 FPS. Specifically, we utilize 3D Gaussians (3DGs) to represent the scene. Instead of the na\\\"ive approach of directly optimizing 3DGs per-frame, we employ a compact Neural Transformation Cache (NTC) to model the translations and rotations of 3DGs, markedly reducing the training time and storage required for each FVV frame. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive 3DG addition strategy to handle emerging objects in dynamic scenes. Experiments demonstrate that 3DGStream achieves competitive performance in terms of rendering speed, image quality, training time, and model storage when compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting has made a marked impact on neural rendering by achieving impressive fidelity and performance. Despite this achievement, however, it is not readily applicable to developing interactive applications. Real-time applications like XR apps and games require functions such as animation, UV-mapping, and model editing simultaneously manipulated through the usage of a 3D model. We propose a modeling that is analogous to typical 3D models, which we call 3D Gaussian Model (3DGM); it provides a manipulatable proxy for novel animation and texture transfer. By binding the 3D Gaussians in texture space and re-projecting them back to world space through implicit shell mapping, we show how our 3D modeling can serve as a valid rendering methodology for interactive applications. It is further noted that recently, 3D mesh reconstruction works have been able to produce high-quality mesh for rendering. Our work, on the other hand, only requires an approximated geometry for rendering an object in high fidelity. Applicationwise, we will show that our proxy-based 3DGM is capable of driving novel animation without animated training data and texture transferring via UV mapping of the 3D Gaussians. We believe the result indicates the potential of our work for enabling interactive applications for 3D Gaussian Splatting.",

To address these challenges, we present VastGaussian, the first method for high-quality reconstruction and real-time rendering on large scenes based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. We propose a progressive partitioning strategy to divide a large scene into multiple cells, where the training cameras and point cloud are properly distributed with an airspace-aware visibility criterion.

We also introduce decoupled appearance modeling into the optimization process to reduce appearance variations in the rendered images.

Precise pose is crucial for correct shape and appearance reconstruction. Secondly, we address the problems of unbalanced aggregation and initialization bias that previously diminished the quality of 3D Gaussian avatars, through a novel surface-guided re-initialization method that ensures accurate alignment of 3D Gaussian points with avatar surfaces.

Nevertheless, despite its exceptional rendering quality and performance on standard datasets, 3D-GS frequently encounters difficulties in accurately modeling specular and anisotropic components. This issue stems from the limited ability of spherical harmonics (SH) to represent high-frequency information. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Spec-Gaussian, an approach that utilizes an anisotropic spherical Gaussian (ASG) appearance field instead of SH for modeling the view-dependent appearance of each 3D Gaussian. Additionally, we have developed a coarse-to-fine training strategy to improve learning efficiency and eliminate floaters caused by overfitting in real-world scenes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of rendering quality. Thanks to ASG, we have significantly improved the ability of 3D-GS to model scenes with specular and anisotropic components without increasing the number of 3D Gaussians. This improvement extends the applicability of 3D GS to handle intricate scenarios with specular and anisotropic surfaces. Project page is https://ingra14m.github.io/Spec-Gaussian-website/.",

    "abstract": "The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently brought about a revolution in the field of neural rendering, facilitating high-quality renderings at real-time speed. However, 3DGS heavily depends on the initialized point cloud produced by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques. When tackling with large-scale scenes that unavoidably contain texture-less surfaces, the SfM techniques always fail to produce enough points in these surfaces and cannot provide good initialization for 3DGS. As a result, 3DGS suffers from difficult optimization and low-quality renderings. In this paper, inspired by classical multi-view stereo (MVS) techniques, we propose GaussianPro, a novel method that applies a progressive propagation strategy to guide the densification of the 3D Gaussians. Compared to the simple split and clone strategies used in 3DGS, our method leverages the priors of the existing reconstructed geometries of the scene and patch matching techniques to produce new Gaussians with accurate positions and orientations. Experiments on both large-scale and small-scale scenes validate the effectiveness of our method, where our method significantly surpasses 3DGS on the Waymo dataset, exhibiting an improvement of 1.15dB in terms of PSNR.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) is a new rendering approach that outperforms the neural radiance field (NeRF) in terms of both speed and image quality. 3D-GS represents 3D scenes by utilizing millions of 3D Gaussians and projects these Gaussians onto the 2D image plane for rendering. However, during the rendering process, a substantial number of unnecessary 3D Gaussians exist for the current view direction, resulting in significant computation costs associated with their identification. In this paper, we propose a computational reduction technique that quickly identifies unnecessary 3D Gaussians in real-time for rendering the current view without compromising image quality. This is accomplished through the offline clustering of 3D Gaussians that are close in distance, followed by the projection of these clusters onto a 2D image plane during runtime. Additionally, we analyze the bottleneck associated with the proposed technique when executed on GPUs and propose an efficient hardware architecture that seamlessly supports the proposed scheme. For the Mip-NeRF360 dataset, the proposed technique excludes 63% of 3D Gaussians on average before the 2D image projection, which reduces the overall rendering computation by almost 38.3% without sacrificing peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR).

In the digital era, various realistic human hairstyles are also critical to high-fidelity digital human assets for beauty and inclusivity. Yet, realistic hair modeling and real-time rendering for animation is a formidable challenge due to its sheer number of strands, complicated structures of geometry, and sophisticated interaction with light. This paper presents GaussianHair, a novel explicit hair representation. It enables comprehensive modeling of hair geometry and appearance from images, fostering innovative illumination effects and dynamic animation capabilities. At the heart of GaussianHair is the novel concept of representing each hair strand as a sequence of connected cylindrical 3D Gaussian primitives. This approach not only retains the hair's geometric structure and appearance but also allows for efficient rasterization onto a 2D image plane, facilitating differentiable volumetric rendering. We further enhance this model with the \"GaussianHair Scattering Model\", adept at recreating the slender structure of hair strands and accurately capturing their local diffuse color in uniform lighting. Through extensive experiments, we substantiate that GaussianHair achieves breakthroughs in both geometric and appearance fidelity, transcending the limitations encountered in state-of-the-art methods for hair reconstruction. Beyond representation, GaussianHair extends to support editing, relighting, and dynamic rendering of hair, offering seamless integration with conventional CG pipeline workflows. Complementing these advancements, we have compiled an extensive dataset of real human hair, each with meticulously detailed strand geometry, to propel further research in this field.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing and rendering 3D objects from highly sparse views is of critical importance for promoting applications of 3D vision techniques and improving user experience. However, images from sparse views only contain very limited 3D information, leading to two significant challenges: 1) Difficulty in building multi-view consistency as images for matching are too few; 2) Partially omitted or highly compressed object information as view coverage is insufficient. To tackle these challenges, we propose GaussianObject, a framework to represent and render the 3D object with Gaussian splatting that achieves high rendering quality with only 4 input images. We first introduce techniques of visual hull and floater elimination, which explicitly inject structure priors into the initial optimization process to help build multi-view consistency, yielding a coarse 3D Gaussian representation. Then we construct a Gaussian repair model based on diffusion models to supplement the omitted object information, where Gaussians are further refined. We design a self-generating strategy to obtain image pairs for training the repair model. We further design a COLMAP-free variant, where pre-given accurate camera poses are not required, which achieves competitive quality and facilitates wider applications. GaussianObject is evaluated on several challenging datasets, including MipNeRF360, OmniObject3D, OpenIllumination, and our-collected unposed images, achieving superior performance from only four views and significantly outperforming previous SOTA methods.

However, it may require a large number of Gaussians, which creates a substantial memory footprint. This paper introduces GES (Generalized Exponential Splatting), a novel representation that employs Generalized Exponential Function (GEF) to model 3D scenes, requiring far fewer particles to represent a scene and thus significantly outperforming Gaussian Splatting methods in efficiency with a plug-and-play replacement ability for Gaussian-based utilities. GES is validated theoretically and empirically in both principled 1D setup and realistic 3D scenes.   It is shown to represent signals with sharp edges more accurately, which are typically challenging for Gaussians due to their inherent low-pass characteristics. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that GEF outperforms Gaussians in fitting natural-occurring signals (e.g. squares, triangles, and parabolic signals), thereby reducing the need for extensive splitting operations that increase the memory footprint of Gaussian Splatting. With the aid of a frequency-modulated loss, GES achieves competitive performance in novel-view synthesis benchmarks while requiring less than half the memory storage of Gaussian Splatting and increasing the rendering speed by up to 39%.

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective subject identity controllable video generation framework, termed Video Custom Diffusion (VCD). With a specified identity defined by a few images, VCD reinforces the identity characteristics and injects frame-wise correlation at the initialization stage for stable video outputs. To achieve this, we propose three novel components that are essential for high-quality identity preservation and stable video generation: 1) a noise initialization method with 3D Gaussian Noise Prior for better inter-frame stability; 2) an ID module based on extended Textual Inversion trained with the cropped identity to disentangle the ID information from the background 3) Face VCD and Tiled VCD modules to reinforce faces and upscale the video to higher resolution while preserving the identity's features. We conducted extensive experiments to verify that VCD is able to generate stable videos with better ID over the baselines. Besides, with the transferability of the encoded identity in the ID module, VCD is also working well with personalized text-to-image models available publicly.

    "abstract": "Most text-to-3D generators build upon off-the-shelf text-to-image models trained on billions of images. They use variants of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which is slow, somewhat unstable, and prone to artifacts. A mitigation is to fine-tune the 2D generator to be multi-view aware, which can help distillation or can be combined with reconstruction networks to output 3D objects directly. In this paper, we further explore the design space of text-to-3D models. We significantly improve multi-view generation by considering video instead of image generators. Combined with a 3D reconstruction algorithm which, by using Gaussian splatting, can optimize a robust image-based loss, we directly produce high-quality 3D outputs from the generated views. Our new method, IM-3D, reduces the number of evaluations of the 2D generator network 10-100x, resulting in a much more efficient pipeline, better quality, fewer geometric inconsistencies, and higher yield of usable 3D assets.",

    "abstract": "Numerous emerging deep-learning techniques have had a substantial impact on computer graphics. Among the most promising breakthroughs are the rise of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). NeRFs encode the object's shape and color in neural network weights using a handful of images with known camera positions to generate novel views. In contrast, GS provides accelerated training and inference without a decrease in rendering quality by encoding the object's characteristics in a collection of Gaussian distributions. These two techniques have found many use cases in spatial computing and other domains. On the other hand, the emergence of deepfake methods has sparked considerable controversy. Deepfakes refers to artificial intelligence-generated videos that closely mimic authentic footage. Using generative models, they can modify facial features, enabling the creation of altered identities or expressions that exhibit a remarkably realistic appearance to a real person. Despite these controversies, deepfake can offer a next-generation solution for avatar creation and gaming when of desirable quality. To that end, we show how to combine all these emerging technologies to obtain a more plausible outcome. Our ImplicitDeepfake uses the classical deepfake algorithm to modify all training images separately and then train NeRF and GS on modified faces. Such simple strategies can produce plausible 3D deepfake-based avatars.",

To address this problem, we propose GS-CLIP for the first attempt to introduce 3DGS (3D Gaussian Splatting) into multimodal pre-training to enhance 3D representation. GS-CLIP leverages a pre-trained vision-language model for a learned common visual and textual space on massive real world image-text pairs and then learns a 3D Encoder for aligning 3DGS optimized per object.

    "abstract": "Creating digital avatars from textual prompts has long been a desirable yet challenging task. Despite the promising results achieved with 2D diffusion priors, current methods struggle to create high-quality and consistent animated avatars efficiently. Previous animatable head models like FLAME have difficulty in accurately representing detailed texture and geometry. Additionally, high-quality 3D static representations face challenges in semantically driving with dynamic priors. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{HeadStudio}, a novel framework that utilizes 3D Gaussian splatting to generate realistic and animatable avatars from text prompts. Firstly, we associate 3D Gaussians with animatable head prior model, facilitating semantic animation on high-quality 3D representations. To ensure consistent animation, we further enhance the optimization from initialization, distillation, and regularization to jointly learn the shape, texture, and animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of HeadStudio in generating animatable avatars from textual prompts, exhibiting appealing appearances. The avatars are capable of rendering high-quality real-time ($\\geq 40$ fps) novel views at a resolution of 1024. Moreover, These avatars can be smoothly driven by real-world speech and video. We hope that HeadStudio can enhance digital avatar creation and gain popularity in the community. Code is at: https://github.com/ZhenglinZhou/HeadStudio.",

    "abstract": "Neural implicit representations, including Neural Distance Fields and Neural Radiance Fields, have demonstrated significant capabilities for reconstructing surfaces with complicated geometry and topology, and generating novel views of a scene. Nevertheless, it is challenging for users to directly deform or manipulate these implicit representations with large deformations in the real-time fashion. Gaussian Splatting(GS) has recently become a promising method with explicit geometry for representing static scenes and facilitating high-quality and real-time synthesis of novel views. However,it cannot be easily deformed due to the use of discrete Gaussians and lack of explicit topology. To address this, we develop a novel GS-based method that enables interactive deformation. Our key idea is to design an innovative mesh-based GS representation, which is integrated into Gaussian learning and manipulation. 3D Gaussians are defined over an explicit mesh, and they are bound with each other: the rendering of 3D Gaussians guides the mesh face split for adaptive refinement, and the mesh face split directs the splitting of 3D Gaussians. Moreover, the explicit mesh constraints help regularize the Gaussian distribution, suppressing poor-quality Gaussians(e.g. misaligned Gaussians,long-narrow shaped Gaussians), thus enhancing visual quality and avoiding artifacts during deformation. Based on this representation, we further introduce a large-scale Gaussian deformation technique to enable deformable GS, which alters the parameters of 3D Gaussians according to the manipulation of the associated mesh. Our method benefits from existing mesh deformation datasets for more realistic data-driven Gaussian deformation. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves high-quality reconstruction and effective deformation, while maintaining the promising rendering results at a high frame rate(65 FPS on average).",

The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown improvements in rendering quality and training efficiency. However, it still remains a challenge to accurately model and disentangle head movements and facial expressions from a single-view capture to achieve high-quality renderings. In this paper, we introduce Rig3DGS to address this challenge. We represent the entire scene, including the dynamic subject, using a set of 3D Gaussians in a canonical space. Using a set of control signals, such as head pose and expressions, we transform them to the 3D space with learned deformations to generate the desired rendering. Our key innovation is a carefully designed deformation method which is guided by a learnable prior derived from a 3D morphable model. This approach is highly efficient in training and effective in controlling facial expressions, head positions, and view synthesis across various captures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned deformation through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Recent neural approaches have accomplished exceptional NVS results for static 3D scenes, but extensions to 4D time-varying scenes remain non-trivial. Prior efforts often encode dynamics by learning a canonical space plus implicit or explicit deformation fields, which struggle in challenging scenarios like sudden movements or generating high-fidelity renderings. In this paper, we introduce 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DRotorGS), a novel method that represents dynamic scenes with anisotropic 4D XYZT Gaussians, inspired by the success of 3D Gaussian Splatting in static scenes. We model dynamics at each timestamp by temporally slicing the 4D Gaussians, which naturally compose dynamic 3D Gaussians and can be seamlessly projected into images. As an explicit spatial-temporal representation, 4DRotorGS demonstrates powerful capabilities for modeling complicated dynamics and fine details--especially for scenes with abrupt motions. We further implement our temporal slicing and splatting techniques in a highly optimized CUDA acceleration framework, achieving real-time inference rendering speeds of up to 277 FPS on an RTX 3090 GPU and 583 FPS on an RTX 4090 GPU. Rigorous evaluations on scenes with diverse motions showcase the superior efficiency and effectiveness of 4DRotorGS, which consistently outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

To solve this, we introduce the Gaussian Mesh Splatting (GaMeS) model, which allows modification of Gaussian components in a similar way as meshes. We parameterize each Gaussian component by the vertices of the mesh face. Furthermore, our model needs mesh initialization on input or estimated mesh during training. We also define Gaussian splats solely based on their location on the mesh, allowing for automatic adjustments in position, scale, and rotation during animation. As a result, we obtain a real-time rendering of editable GS.",

In practical applications, input panoramas are often sparse, leading to unreliable initialization of 3D Gaussians and subsequent degradation of 3D-GS quality. In addition, due to the under-constrained geometry of texture-less planes (e.g., walls and floors), 3D-GS struggles to model these flat regions with elliptical Gaussians, resulting in significant floaters in novel views. To address these issues, we propose 360-GS, a novel $360^{\\circ}$ Gaussian splatting for a limited set of panoramic inputs. Instead of splatting 3D Gaussians directly onto the spherical surface, 360-GS projects them onto the tangent plane of the unit sphere and then maps them to the spherical projections. This adaptation enables the representation of the projection using Gaussians. We guide the optimization of 360-GS by exploiting layout priors within panoramas, which are simple to obtain and contain strong structural information about the indoor scene. Our experimental results demonstrate that 360-GS allows panoramic rendering and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer artifacts in novel view synthesis, thus providing immersive roaming in indoor scenarios.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting has garnered extensive attention and application in real-time neural rendering. Concurrently, concerns have been raised about the limitations of this technology in aspects such as point cloud storage, performance, and robustness in sparse viewpoints, leading to various improvements. However, there has been a notable lack of attention to the fundamental problem of projection errors introduced by the local affine approximation inherent in the splatting itself, and the consequential impact of these errors on the quality of photo-realistic rendering. This paper addresses the projection error function of 3D Gaussian Splatting, commencing with the residual error from the first-order Taylor expansion of the projection function. The analysis establishes a correlation between the error and the Gaussian mean position. Subsequently, leveraging function optimization theory, this paper analyzes the function's minima to provide an optimal projection strategy for Gaussian Splatting referred to Optimal Gaussian Splatting, which can accommodate a variety of camera models. Experimental validation further confirms that this projection methodology reduces artifacts, resulting in a more convincingly realistic rendering.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a prominent model for constructing 3D representations from images across diverse domains. However, the efficiency of the 3D Gaussian Splatting rendering pipeline relies on several simplifications. Notably, reducing Gaussian to 2D splats with a single view-space depth introduces popping and blending artifacts during view rotation. Addressing this issue requires accurate per-pixel depth computation, yet a full per-pixel sort proves excessively costly compared to a global sort operation. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical rasterization approach that systematically resorts and culls splats with minimal processing overhead. Our software rasterizer effectively eliminates popping artifacts and view inconsistencies, as demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative measurements. Simultaneously, our method mitigates the potential for cheating view-dependent effects with popping, ensuring a more authentic representation. Despite the elimination of cheating, our approach achieves comparable quantitative results for test images, while increasing the consistency for novel view synthesis in motion. Due to its design, our hierarchical approach is only 4% slower on average than the original Gaussian Splatting. Notably, enforcing consistency enables a reduction in the number of Gaussians by approximately half with nearly identical quality and view-consistency. Consequently, rendering performance is nearly doubled, making our approach 1.6x faster than the original Gaussian Splatting, with a 50% reduction in memory requirements.",

The framework operates by first representing the data as a three-dimensional tensor, capturing dimensions of learners, questions, and attempts. It then densifies the data through tensor factorization and augments it using Generative AI models, tailored to individual learning patterns identified via clustering. Applied to data from an AutoTutor lesson by the Center for the Study of Adult Literacy (CSAL), the 3DG framework effectively generated scalable, personalized simulations of learning performance. Comparative analysis revealed GAN's superior reliability over GPT-4 in this context, underscoring its potential in addressing data sparsity challenges in ITSs and contributing to the advancement of personalized educational technology.",

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods have recently risen to prominence for their exceptional ability to reconstruct scenes but are hampered by slow inference speed, prolonged training, and inconsistent depth estimation. Some previous work utilizes ground truth depth for optimization but is hard to acquire in the surgical domain. To overcome these obstacles, we present Endo-4DGS, a real-time endoscopic dynamic reconstruction approach that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) for 3D representation. Specifically, we propose lightweight MLPs to capture temporal dynamics with Gaussian deformation fields. To obtain a satisfactory Gaussian Initialization, we exploit a powerful depth estimation foundation model, Depth-Anything, to generate pseudo-depth maps as a geometry prior. We additionally propose confidence-guided learning to tackle the ill-pose problems in monocular depth estimation and enhance the depth-guided reconstruction with surface normal constraints and depth regularization. Our approach has been validated on two surgical datasets, where it can effectively render in real-time, compute efficiently, and reconstruct with remarkable accuracy.",

With the image prompt, users can conveniently specify the detailed appearance/style of the target content in complement to the text description, enabling accurate control of the appearance.

Although 3D Gaussian has been demonstrated to possess promising capability for geometry representation and radiance field reconstruction, applying 3D Gaussian in head avatar creation remains a major challenge since it is difficult for 3D Gaussian to model the head shape variations caused by changing poses and expressions. In this paper, we introduce PSAvatar, a novel framework for animatable head avatar creation that utilizes discrete geometric primitive to create a parametric morphable shape model and employs 3D Gaussian for fine detail representation and high fidelity rendering. The parametric morphable shape model is a Point-based Morphable Shape Model (PMSM) which uses points instead of meshes for 3D representation to achieve enhanced representation flexibility. The PMSM first converts the FLAME mesh to points by sampling on the surfaces as well as off the meshes to enable the reconstruction of not only surface-like structures but also complex geometries such as eyeglasses and hairstyles. By aligning these points with the head shape in an analysis-by-synthesis manner, the PMSM makes it possible to utilize 3D Gaussian for fine detail representation and appearance modeling, thus enabling the creation of high-fidelity avatars. We show that PSAvatar can reconstruct high-fidelity head avatars of a variety of subjects and the avatars can be animated in real-time ($\\ge$ 25 fps at a resolution of 512 $\\times$ 512 ).",

However, existing methods suffer from slow rendering speed, greatly limiting their practical use. In this paper, we introduce EndoGaussian, a real-time endoscopic scene reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By integrating the efficient Gaussian representation and highly-optimized rendering engine, our framework significantly boosts the rendering speed to a real-time level. To adapt 3DGS for endoscopic scenes, we propose two strategies, Holistic Gaussian Initialization (HGI) and Spatio-temporal Gaussian Tracking (SGT), to handle the non-trivial Gaussian initialization and tissue deformation problems, respectively. In HGI, we leverage recent depth estimation models to predict depth maps of input binocular/monocular image sequences, based on which pixels are re-projected and combined for holistic initialization. In SPT, we propose to model surface dynamics using a deformation field, which is composed of an efficient encoding voxel and a lightweight deformation decoder, allowing for Gaussian tracking with minor training and rendering burden. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate our efficacy against prior SOTAs in many aspects, including better rendering speed (195 FPS real-time, 100$\\times$ gain), better rendering quality (37.848 PSNR), and less training overhead (within 2 min/scene), showing significant promise for intraoperative surgery applications.

    "abstract": "Surgical 3D reconstruction is a critical area of research in robotic surgery, with recent works adopting variants of dynamic radiance fields to achieve success in 3D reconstruction of deformable tissues from single-viewpoint videos. However, these methods often suffer from time-consuming optimization or inferior quality, limiting their adoption in downstream tasks. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, a recent trending 3D representation, we present EndoGS, applying Gaussian Splatting for deformable endoscopic tissue reconstruction. Specifically, our approach incorporates deformation fields to handle dynamic scenes, depth-guided supervision with spatial-temporal weight masks to optimize 3D targets with tool occlusion from a single viewpoint, and surface-aligned regularization terms to capture the much better geometry. As a result, EndoGS reconstructs and renders high-quality deformable endoscopic tissues from a single-viewpoint video, estimated depth maps, and labeled tool masks. Experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos demonstrate that EndoGS achieves superior rendering quality. Code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/EndoGS.",

Compared with the costly neural radiance based models, 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently demonstrated great performance in terms of training time and rendering quality. However, applying the static 3D Gaussian Splatting model to the dynamic human reconstruction problem is non-trivial due to complicated non-rigid deformations and rich cloth details. To address these challenges, our method considers explicit pose-guided deformation to associate dynamic Gaussians across the canonical space and the observation space, introducing a physically-based prior with regularized transformations helps mitigate ambiguity between the two spaces. During the training process, we further propose a pose refinement strategy to update the pose regression for compensating the inaccurate initial estimation and a split-with-scale mechanism to enhance the density of regressed point clouds. The experiments validate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art photorealistic novel-view rendering results with high-quality details for dynamic clothed human bodies, along with explicit geometry reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Generating dynamic 3D object from a single-view video is challenging due to the lack of 4D labeled data. An intuitive approach is to extend previous image-to-3D pipelines by transferring off-the-shelf image generation models such as score distillation sampling.However, this approach would be slow and expensive to scale due to the need for back-propagating the information-limited supervision signals through a large pretrained model. To address this, we propose an efficient video-to-4D object generation framework called Efficient4D. It generates high-quality spacetime-consistent images under different camera views, and then uses them as labeled data to directly reconstruct the 4D content through a 4D Gaussian splatting model. Importantly, our method can achieve real-time rendering under continuous camera trajectories. To enable robust reconstruction under sparse views, we introduce inconsistency-aware confidence-weighted loss design, along with a lightly weighted score distillation loss. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos show that Efficient4D offers a remarkable 10-fold increase in speed when compared to prior art alternatives while preserving the quality of novel view synthesis. For example, Efficient4D takes only 10 minutes to model a dynamic object, vs 120 minutes by the previous art model Consistent4D.",

Autonomous driving, a vibrant front in AI applications, remains challenged by the lack of dedicated vision foundation models (VFMs).

It is particularly difficult to include shadows as they are a global effect and the required casting of secondary rays is costly. We propose a new shadow model using a Gaussian density proxy that replaces sampling with a simple analytic formula. It supports dynamic motion and is tailored for shadow computation, thereby avoiding the affine projection approximation and sorting required by the closely related Gaussian splatting. Combined with a deferred neural rendering model, our Gaussian shadows enable Lambertian shading and shadow casting with minimal overhead. We demonstrate improved reconstructions, with better separation of albedo, shading, and shadows in challenging outdoor scenes with direct sun light and hard shadows. Our method is able to optimize the light direction without any input from the user. As a result, novel poses have fewer shadow artifacts and relighting in novel scenes is more realistic compared to the state-of-the-art methods, providing new ways to pose neural characters in novel environments, increasing their applicability.",

    "abstract": "Point-based radiance field rendering has demonstrated impressive results for novel view synthesis, offering a compelling blend of rendering quality and computational efficiency. However, also latest approaches in this domain are not without their shortcomings. 3D Gaussian Splatting [Kerbl and Kopanas et al. 2023] struggles when tasked with rendering highly detailed scenes, due to blurring and cloudy artifacts. On the other hand, ADOP [R\\\"uckert et al. 2022] can accommodate crisper images, but the neural reconstruction network decreases performance, it grapples with temporal instability and it is unable to effectively address large gaps in the point cloud.   In this paper, we present TRIPS (Trilinear Point Splatting), an approach that combines ideas from both Gaussian Splatting and ADOP. The fundamental concept behind our novel technique involves rasterizing points into a screen-space image pyramid, with the selection of the pyramid layer determined by the projected point size. This approach allows rendering arbitrarily large points using a single trilinear write. A lightweight neural network is then used to reconstruct a hole-free image including detail beyond splat resolution. Importantly, our render pipeline is entirely differentiable, allowing for automatic optimization of both point sizes and positions.   Our evaluation demonstrate that TRIPS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of rendering quality while maintaining a real-time frame rate of 60 frames per second on readily available hardware. This performance extends to challenging scenarios, such as scenes featuring intricate geometry, expansive landscapes, and auto-exposed footage.

However, existing models, especially the efficient 3D Gaussian-based methods, struggle to produce compact segmentation results. This issue stems primarily from their redundant learnable attributes assigned on individual Gaussians, leading to a lack of robustness against the 3D-inconsistencies in zero-shot generated raw labels. To address this problem, our work, named Compact Segmented 3D Gaussians (CoSegGaussians), proposes the Feature Unprojection and Fusion module as the segmentation field, which utilizes a shallow decoder generalizable for all Gaussians based on high-level features. Specifically, leveraging the learned Gaussian geometric parameters, semantic-aware image-based features are introduced into the scene via our unprojection technique. The lifted features, together with spatial information, are fed into the multi-scale aggregation decoder to generate segmentation identities for all Gaussians. Furthermore, we design CoSeg Loss to boost model robustness against 3D-inconsistent noises. Experimental results show that our model surpasses baselines on zero-shot semantic segmentation task, improving by ~10% mIoU over the best baseline.

Due to its superior rendering efficiency, 3D Gaussian splatting-based models have recently excelled in both 3D reconstruction and generation. 3D Gaussian splatting approaches for image to 3D generation are often optimization-based, requiring many computationally expensive score-distillation steps. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an Amortized Generative 3D Gaussian framework (AGG) that instantly produces 3D Gaussians from a single image, eliminating the need for per-instance optimization. Utilizing an intermediate hybrid representation, AGG decomposes the generation of 3D Gaussian locations and other appearance attributes for joint optimization. Moreover, we propose a cascaded pipeline that first generates a coarse representation of the 3D data and later upsamples it with a 3D Gaussian super-resolution module. Our method is evaluated against existing optimization-based 3D Gaussian frameworks and sampling-based pipelines utilizing other 3D representations, where AGG showcases competitive generation abilities both qualitatively and quantitatively while being several orders of magnitude faster.

We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the emergence of 3D GS, laying the groundwork for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS.

This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility.

The enhanced fidelity in stable diffusion, coupled with control methods that ensure multi-view consistency, and realistic human models like SMPL-X, contribute synergistically to the production of 3D models with remarkable consistency and near-realistic appearances. The advancements in neural network-based 3D storing and rendering models, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have accelerated the efficiency and realism of neural rendered models. Furthermore, the multimodality capabilities of large language models have enabled language inputs to transcend into human motion outputs. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview and summary of the relevant papers published mostly during the latter half year of 2023.

Leveraging a physics engine enables the simulation of natural object placement within a scene through interaction between meshes extracted for the objects and the environment. Consequently, an extensive amount of new scenes - static or dynamic - can be created by combining different environments and objects. By rendering scenes from various perspectives, diverse data points such as RGB images, depth maps, semantic masks, and 6DoF object poses can be extracted.   Our study demonstrates that training on data generated by PEGASUS enables pose estimation networks to successfully transfer from synthetic data to real-world data.

    "abstract": "This paper aims to tackle the problem of modeling dynamic urban streets for autonomous driving scenes. Recent methods extend NeRF by incorporating tracked vehicle poses to animate vehicles, enabling photo-realistic view synthesis of dynamic urban street scenes. However, significant limitations are their slow training and rendering speed. We introduce Street Gaussians, a new explicit scene representation that tackles these limitations. Specifically, the dynamic urban scene is represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic logits and 3D Gaussians, each associated with either a foreground vehicle or the background. To model the dynamics of foreground object vehicles, each object point cloud is optimized with optimizable tracked poses, along with a 4D spherical harmonics model for the dynamic appearance. The explicit representation allows easy composition of object vehicles and background, which in turn allows for scene editing operations and rendering at 135 FPS (1066 $\\times$ 1600 resolution) within half an hour of training. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple challenging benchmarks, including KITTI and Waymo Open datasets. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all datasets. The code will be released to ensure reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in Radiance Fields have paved the robust way for novel view synthesis with their photorealistic rendering quality. Nevertheless, they usually employ neural networks and volumetric rendering, which are costly to train and impede their broad use in various real-time applications due to the lengthy rendering time. Lately 3D Gaussians splatting-based approach has been proposed to model the 3D scene, and it achieves remarkable visual quality while rendering the images in real-time. However, it suffers from severe degradation in the rendering quality if the training images are blurry. Blurriness commonly occurs due to the lens defocusing, object motion, and camera shake, and it inevitably intervenes in clean image acquisition. Several previous studies have attempted to render clean and sharp images from blurry input images using neural fields. The majority of those works, however, are designed only for volumetric rendering-based neural radiance fields and are not straightforwardly applicable to rasterization-based 3D Gaussian splatting methods. Thus, we propose a novel real-time deblurring framework, Deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting, using a small Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that manipulates the covariance of each 3D Gaussian to model the scene blurriness. While Deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting can still enjoy real-time rendering, it can reconstruct fine and sharp details from blurry images. A variety of experiments have been conducted on the benchmark, and the results have revealed the effectiveness of our approach for deblurring.

    "abstract": "Aided by text-to-image and text-to-video diffusion models, existing 4D content creation pipelines utilize score distillation sampling to optimize the entire dynamic 3D scene. However, as these pipelines generate 4D content from text or image inputs directly, they are constrained by limited motion capabilities and depend on unreliable prompt engineering for desired results. To address these problems, this work introduces \\textbf{4DGen}, a novel framework for grounded 4D content creation. We identify monocular video sequences as a key component in constructing the 4D content. Our pipeline facilitates controllable 4D generation, enabling users to specify the motion via monocular video or adopt image-to-video generations, thus offering superior control over content creation. Furthermore, we construct our 4D representation using dynamic 3D Gaussians, which permits efficient, high-resolution supervision through rendering during training, thereby facilitating high-quality 4D generation. Additionally, we employ spatial-temporal pseudo labels on anchor frames, along with seamless consistency priors implemented through 3D-aware score distillation sampling and smoothness regularizations. Compared to existing video-to-4D baselines, our approach yields superior results in faithfully reconstructing input signals and realistically inferring renderings from novel viewpoints and timesteps. More importantly, compared to previous image-to-4D and text-to-4D works, 4DGen supports grounded generation, offering users enhanced control and improved motion generation capabilities, a feature difficult to achieve with previous methods.

However, existing methods suffer from long optimization times, a lack of motion controllability, and a low quality of details. In this paper, we introduce DreamGaussian4D (DG4D), an efficient 4D generation framework that builds on Gaussian Splatting (GS). Our key insight is that combining explicit modeling of spatial transformations with static GS makes an efficient and powerful representation for 4D generation. Moreover, video generation methods have the potential to offer valuable spatial-temporal priors, enhancing the high-quality 4D generation. Specifically, we propose an integral framework with two major modules: 1) Image-to-4D GS - we initially generate static GS with DreamGaussianHD, followed by HexPlane-based dynamic generation with Gaussian deformation; and 2) Video-to-Video Texture Refinement - we refine the generated UV-space texture maps and meanwhile enhance their temporal consistency by utilizing a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model. Notably, DG4D reduces the optimization time from several hours to just a few minutes, allows the generated 3D motion to be visually controlled, and produces animated meshes that can be realistically rendered in 3D engines.",

Despite recent advancements, simultaneously achieving high-resolution photorealistic results, real-time rendering, and compact storage remains a formidable task. To address these challenges, we propose Spacetime Gaussian Feature Splatting as a novel dynamic scene representation, composed of three pivotal components. First, we formulate expressive Spacetime Gaussians by enhancing 3D Gaussians with temporal opacity and parametric motion/rotation. This enables Spacetime Gaussians to capture static, dynamic, as well as transient content within a scene. Second, we introduce splatted feature rendering, which replaces spherical harmonics with neural features. These features facilitate the modeling of view- and time-dependent appearance while maintaining small size. Third, we leverage the guidance of training error and coarse depth to sample new Gaussians in areas that are challenging to converge with existing pipelines. Experiments on several established real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and speed, while retaining compact storage. At 8K resolution, our lite-version model can render at 60 FPS on an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU. Our code is available at https://github.com/oppo-us-research/SpacetimeGaussians.",

    "abstract": "Humans live in a 3D world and commonly use natural language to interact with a 3D scene. Modeling a 3D language field to support open-ended language queries in 3D has gained increasing attention recently. This paper introduces LangSplat, which constructs a 3D language field that enables precise and efficient open-vocabulary querying within 3D spaces. Unlike existing methods that ground CLIP language embeddings in a NeRF model, LangSplat advances the field by utilizing a collection of 3D Gaussians, each encoding language features distilled from CLIP, to represent the language field. By employing a tile-based splatting technique for rendering language features, we circumvent the costly rendering process inherent in NeRF. Instead of directly learning CLIP embeddings, LangSplat first trains a scene-wise language autoencoder and then learns language features on the scene-specific latent space, thereby alleviating substantial memory demands imposed by explicit modeling. Existing methods struggle with imprecise and vague 3D language fields, which fail to discern clear boundaries between objects. We delve into this issue and propose to learn hierarchical semantics using SAM, thereby eliminating the need for extensively querying the language field across various scales and the regularization of DINO features. Extensive experimental results show that LangSplat significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method LERF by a large margin. Notably, LangSplat is extremely efficient, achieving a 199 $\\times$ speedup compared to LERF at the resolution of 1440 $\\times$ 1080.

These advantages signal a wide range of applications for 3D Gaussians in 3D understanding and editing. Meanwhile, the segmentation of 3D Gaussians is still in its infancy. The existing segmentation methods are not only cumbersome but also incapable of segmenting multiple objects simultaneously in a short amount of time. In response, this paper introduces a 3D Gaussian segmentation method implemented with 2D segmentation as supervision. This approach uses input 2D segmentation maps to guide the learning of the added 3D Gaussian semantic information, while nearest neighbor clustering and statistical filtering refine the segmentation results. Experiments show that our concise method can achieve comparable performances on mIOU and mAcc for multi-object segmentation as previous single-object segmentation methods.",

Recently, 3D Gaussian has been applied to model complex natural scenes, demonstrating fast convergence and better rendering of novel views compared to implicit neural representations (INRs). Taking inspiration from the successful application of 3D Gaussians in natural scene modeling and novel view synthesis, we investigate their potential for sparse-view CT reconstruction. We leverage prior information from the filtered-backprojection reconstructed image to initialize the Gaussians; and update their parameters via comparing difference in the projection space. Performance is further enhanced by adaptive density control. Compared to INRs, 3D Gaussians benefit more from prior information to explicitly bypass learning in void spaces and allocate the capacity efficiently, accelerating convergence. 3D Gaussians also efficiently learn high-frequency details. Trained in a self-supervised manner, 3D Gaussians avoid the need for large-scale paired data. Our experiments on the AAPM-Mayo dataset demonstrate that 3D Gaussians can provide superior performance compared to INR-based methods.

ParDy-Human introduces parameter-driven dynamics into 3D Gaussian Splatting where 3D Gaussians are deformed by a human pose model to animate the avatar. Our method is composed of two parts: A first module that deforms canonical 3D Gaussians according to SMPL vertices and a consecutive module that further takes their designed joint encodings and predicts per Gaussian deformations to deal with dynamics beyond SMPL vertex deformations. Images are then synthesized by a rasterizer. ParDy-Human constitutes an explicit model for realistic dynamic human avatars which requires significantly fewer training views and images. Our avatars learning is free of additional annotations such as masks and can be trained with variable backgrounds while inferring full-resolution images efficiently even on consumer hardware. We provide experimental evidence to show that ParDy-Human outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ZJU-MoCap and THUman4.0 datasets both quantitatively and visually.",

Crucial to AYG is a novel method to regularize the distribution of the moving 3D Gaussians and thereby stabilize the optimization and induce motion. We also propose a motion amplification mechanism as well as a new autoregressive synthesis scheme to generate and combine multiple 4D sequences for longer generation. These techniques allow us to synthesize vivid dynamic scenes, outperform previous work qualitatively and quantitatively and achieve state-of-the-art text-to-4D performance.

By encoding the shape and color information within neural network weights, NeRFs excel at producing strikingly sharp novel views of 3D objects. Recently, numerous generalizations of NeRFs utilizing generative models have emerged, expanding its versatility. In contrast, Gaussian Splatting (GS) offers a similar render quality with faster training and inference as it does not need neural networks to work. It encodes information about the 3D objects in the set of Gaussian distributions that can be rendered in 3D similarly to classical meshes. Unfortunately, GS are difficult to condition since they usually require circa hundred thousand Gaussian components. To mitigate the caveats of both models, we propose a hybrid model Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) that uses GS representation of the 3D object's shape and NeRF-based encoding of color and opacity. Our model uses Gaussian distributions with trainable positions (i.e. means of Gaussian), shape (i.e. covariance of Gaussian), color and opacity, and a neural network that takes Gaussian parameters and viewing direction to produce changes in the said color and opacity. As a result, our model better describes shadows, light reflections, and the transparency of 3D objects without adding additional texture and light components.",

Splatter Image is based on Gaussian Splatting, which allows fast and high-quality reconstruction of 3D scenes from multiple images. We apply Gaussian Splatting to monocular reconstruction by learning a neural network that, at test time, performs reconstruction in a feed-forward manner, at 38 FPS. Our main innovation is the surprisingly straightforward design of this network, which, using 2D operators, maps the input image to one 3D Gaussian per pixel. The resulting set of Gaussians thus has the form an image, the Splatter Image. We further extend the method take several images as input via cross-view attention. Owning to the speed of the renderer (588 FPS), we use a single GPU for training while generating entire images at each iteration to optimize perceptual metrics like LPIPS. On several synthetic, real, multi-category and large-scale benchmark datasets, we achieve better results in terms of PSNR, LPIPS, and other metrics while training and evaluating much faster than prior works.

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis has shown rapid progress recently, with methods capable of producing increasingly photorealistic results. 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a promising method, producing high-quality renderings of scenes and enabling interactive viewing at real-time frame rates. However, it is limited to static scenes. In this work, we extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct dynamic scenes. We model a scene's dynamics using dynamic MLPs, learning deformations from temporally-local canonical representations to per-frame 3D Gaussians. To disentangle static and dynamic regions, tuneable parameters weigh each Gaussian's respective MLP parameters, improving the dynamics modelling of imbalanced scenes. We introduce a sliding window training strategy that partitions the sequence into smaller manageable windows to handle arbitrary length scenes while maintaining high rendering quality. We propose an adaptive sampling strategy to determine appropriate window size hyperparameters based on the scene's motion, balancing training overhead with visual quality. Training a separate dynamic 3D Gaussian model for each sliding window allows the canonical representation to change, enabling the reconstruction of scenes with significant geometric changes. Temporal consistency is enforced using a fine-tuning step with self-supervising consistency loss on randomly sampled novel views. As a result, our method produces high-quality renderings of general dynamic scenes with competitive quantitative performance, which can be viewed in real-time in our dynamic interactive viewer.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as a highly promising technique for modeling of static 3D scenes. In contrast to Neural Radiance Fields, it utilizes efficient rasterization allowing for very fast rendering at high-quality. However, the storage size is significantly higher, which hinders practical deployment, e.g. on resource constrained devices. In this paper, we introduce a compact scene representation organizing the parameters of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into a 2D grid with local homogeneity, ensuring a drastic reduction in storage requirements without compromising visual quality during rendering. Central to our idea is the explicit exploitation of perceptual redundancies present in natural scenes. In essence, the inherent nature of a scene allows for numerous permutations of Gaussian parameters to equivalently represent it. To this end, we propose a novel highly parallel algorithm that regularly arranges the high-dimensional Gaussian parameters into a 2D grid while preserving their neighborhood structure. During training, we further enforce local smoothness between the sorted parameters in the grid. The uncompressed Gaussians use the same structure as 3DGS, ensuring a seamless integration with established renderers. Our method achieves a reduction factor of 17x to 42x in size for complex scenes with no increase in training time, marking a substantial leap forward in the domain of 3D scene distribution and consumption.

In this paper, we seek to leverage Gaussian splatting to generate realistic animatable avatars from textual descriptions, addressing the limitations (e.g., flexibility and efficiency) imposed by mesh or NeRF-based representations. However, a naive application of Gaussian splatting cannot generate high-quality animatable avatars and suffers from learning instability; it also cannot capture fine avatar geometries and often leads to degenerate body parts. To tackle these problems, we first propose a primitive-based 3D Gaussian representation where Gaussians are defined inside pose-driven primitives to facilitate animation. Second, to stabilize and amortize the learning of millions of Gaussians, we propose to use neural implicit fields to predict the Gaussian attributes (e.g., colors). Finally, to capture fine avatar geometries and extract detailed meshes, we propose a novel SDF-based implicit mesh learning approach for 3D Gaussians that regularizes the underlying geometries and extracts highly detailed textured meshes. Our proposed method, GAvatar, enables the large-scale generation of diverse animatable avatars using only text prompts. GAvatar significantly surpasses existing methods in terms of both appearance and geometry quality, and achieves extremely fast rendering (100 fps) at 1K resolution.",

Implicit deformable representations commonly model motion with a canonical space and time-dependent backward-warping deformation field. Our method, GauFRe, uses a forward-warping deformation to explicitly model non-rigid transformations of scene geometry. Specifically, we propose a template set of 3D Gaussians residing in a canonical space, and a time-dependent forward-warping deformation field to model dynamic objects. Additionally, we tailor a 3D Gaussian-specific static component supported by an inductive bias-aware initialization approach which allows the deformation field to focus on moving scene regions, improving the rendering of complex real-world motion. The differentiable pipeline is optimized end-to-end with a self-supervised rendering loss. Experiments show our method achieves competitive results and higher efficiency than both previous state-of-the-art NeRF and Gaussian-based methods.

    "abstract": "Many species face the threat of extinction. It's important to study these species and gather information about them as much as possible to preserve biodiversity. Due to the rarity of endangered species, there is a limited amount of data available, making it difficult to apply data requiring generative AI methods to this domain. We aim to study the feasibility of generating consistent and real-like 3D models of endangered animals using limited data. Such a phenomenon leads us to utilize zero-shot stable diffusion models that can generate a 3D model out of a single image of the target species. This paper investigates the intricate relationship between elevation angle and the output quality of 3D model generation, focusing on the innovative approach presented in DreamGaussian. DreamGaussian, a novel framework utilizing Generative Gaussian Splatting along with novel mesh extraction and refinement algorithms, serves as the focal point of our study. We conduct a comprehensive analysis, analyzing the effect of varying elevation angles on DreamGaussian's ability to reconstruct 3D scenes accurately. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate how changes in elevation angle impact the generated images' spatial coherence, structural integrity, and perceptual realism. We observed that giving a correct elevation angle with the input image significantly affects the result of the generated 3D model. We hope this study to be influential for the usability of AI to preserve endangered animals; while the penultimate aim is to obtain a model that can output biologically consistent 3D models via small samples, the qualitative interpretation of an existing state-of-the-art model such as DreamGaussian will be a step forward in our goal.",

Recently, the community has explored fast grid structures for efficient training of clothed avatars. Albeit being extremely fast at training, these methods can barely achieve an interactive rendering frame rate with around 15 FPS. In this paper, we use 3D Gaussian Splatting and learn a non-rigid deformation network to reconstruct animatable clothed human avatars that can be trained within 30 minutes and rendered at real-time frame rates (50+ FPS).

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction from single images have been driven by the evolution of generative models. Prominent among these are methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and the adaptation of diffusion models in the 3D domain. Despite their progress, these techniques often face limitations due to slow optimization or rendering processes, leading to extensive training and optimization times. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for single-view reconstruction that efficiently generates a 3D model from a single image via feed-forward inference. Our method utilizes two transformer-based networks, namely a point decoder and a triplane decoder, to reconstruct 3D objects using a hybrid Triplane-Gaussian intermediate representation. This hybrid representation strikes a balance, achieving a faster rendering speed compared to implicit representations while simultaneously delivering superior rendering quality than explicit representations. The point decoder is designed for generating point clouds from single images, offering an explicit representation which is then utilized by the triplane decoder to query Gaussian features for each point. This design choice addresses the challenges associated with directly regressing explicit 3D Gaussian attributes characterized by their non-structural nature. Subsequently, the 3D Gaussians are decoded by an MLP to enable rapid rendering through splatting. Both decoders are built upon a scalable, transformer-based architecture and have been efficiently trained on large-scale 3D datasets. The evaluations conducted on both synthetic datasets and real-world images demonstrate that our method not only achieves higher quality but also ensures a faster runtime in comparison to previous state-of-the-art techniques.

However, they still struggle with adverse initializations such as large rotations and translations. To address this issue, we propose an efficient method for accurate camera pose estimation by inverting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Specifically, a gradient-based differentiable framework optimizes camera pose by minimizing the residual between the query image and the rendered image, requiring no training. An end-to-end matching module is designed to enhance the model's robustness against adverse initializations, while minimizing pixel-level comparing loss aids in precise pose estimation. Experimental results on synthetic and complex real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in challenging conditions and the accuracy of camera pose estimation.",

To relax this constraint, multiple efforts have been made to train Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) without pre-processed camera poses. However, the implicit representations of NeRFs provide extra challenges to optimize the 3D structure and camera poses at the same time. On the other hand, the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting provides new opportunities given its explicit point cloud representations. This paper leverages both the explicit geometric representation and the continuity of the input video stream to perform novel view synthesis without any SfM preprocessing.

    "abstract": "We present the first application of 3D Gaussian Splatting in monocular SLAM, the most fundamental but the hardest setup for Visual SLAM. Our method, which runs live at 3fps, utilises Gaussians as the only 3D representation, unifying the required representation for accurate, efficient tracking, mapping, and high-quality rendering. Designed for challenging monocular settings, our approach is seamlessly extendable to RGB-D SLAM when an external depth sensor is available. Several innovations are required to continuously reconstruct 3D scenes with high fidelity from a live camera. First, to move beyond the original 3DGS algorithm, which requires accurate poses from an offline Structure from Motion (SfM) system, we formulate camera tracking for 3DGS using direct optimisation against the 3D Gaussians, and show that this enables fast and robust tracking with a wide basin of convergence. Second, by utilising the explicit nature of the Gaussians, we introduce geometric verification and regularisation to handle the ambiguities occurring in incremental 3D dense reconstruction. Finally, we introduce a full SLAM system which not only achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and trajectory estimation but also reconstruction of tiny and even transparent objects.",

While recent advances in neural implicit rendering have unlocked unprecedented photorealism for digital avatars, real-time performance has mostly been demonstrated for static scenes only. To address this, we propose ASH, an animatable Gaussian splatting approach for photorealistic rendering of dynamic humans in real-time. We parameterize the clothed human as animatable 3D Gaussians, which can be efficiently splatted into image space to generate the final rendering. However, naively learning the Gaussian parameters in 3D space poses a severe challenge in terms of compute. Instead, we attach the Gaussians onto a deformable character model, and learn their parameters in 2D texture space, which allows leveraging efficient 2D convolutional architectures that easily scale with the required number of Gaussians. We benchmark ASH with competing methods on pose-controllable avatars, demonstrating that our method outperforms existing real-time methods by a large margin and shows comparable or even better results than offline methods.",

On one hand, methods requiring extensively calibrated multi-view setups are prohibitively complex and resource-intensive, limiting their practical applicability. On the other hand, while single-camera Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) offer a more streamlined approach, they have excessive training and rendering costs. 3D Gaussian Splatting would be a suitable alternative but for two reasons. Firstly, existing methods for 3D dynamic Gaussians require synchronized multi-view cameras, and secondly, the lack of controllability in dynamic scenarios. We present CoGS, a method for Controllable Gaussian Splatting, that enables the direct manipulation of scene elements, offering real-time control of dynamic scenes without the prerequisite of pre-computing control signals. We evaluated CoGS using both synthetic and real-world datasets that include dynamic objects that differ in degree of difficulty.

We compute the normal of each 3D Gaussian using the shortest eigenvector, with a directional masking scheme forcing accurate normal estimation without external supervision. We adopt an efficient voxel-based indirect illumination tracing scheme that stores direction-aware outgoing radiance in each 3D Gaussian to disentangle secondary illumination for approximating multi-bounce light transport. To further enhance the illumination disentanglement, we represent a high-resolution environmental map with a learnable low-resolution map and a lightweight, fully convolutional network. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both relighting and novel view synthesis tasks among the recently proposed inverse rendering methods while achieving real-time rendering.

To address this issue, we propose a novel, unified framework that iteratively optimizes both the 3D model and the diffusion prior. Leveraging the different learnable parameters of the diffusion prior, our approach offers multiple configurations, affording various trade-offs between performance and implementation complexity. Notably, our experimental results demonstrate that our method markedly surpasses existing techniques, establishing new state-of-the-art in the realm of text-to-3D generation.

It addresses the challenges of lengthy training times and slow rendering speeds associated with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Through rapid, differentiable rasterization of 3D Gaussians, 3D-GS achieves real-time rendering and accelerated training. They, however, demand substantial memory resources for both training and storage, as they require millions of Gaussians in their point cloud representation for each scene. We present a technique utilizing quantized embeddings to significantly reduce per-point memory storage requirements and a coarse-to-fine training strategy for a faster and more stable optimization of the Gaussian point clouds. Our approach develops a pruning stage which results in scene representations with fewer Gaussians, leading to faster training times and rendering speeds for real-time rendering of high resolution scenes. We reduce storage memory by more than an order of magnitude all while preserving the reconstruction quality. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of datasets and scenes preserving the visual quality while consuming 10-20x lesser memory and faster training/inference speed.

Recent advancements in head avatar techniques, including explicit 3D morphable meshes (3DMM), point clouds, and neural implicit representation have been exploited for this ongoing research. However, 3DMM-based methods are constrained by their fixed topologies, point-based approaches suffer from a heavy training burden due to the extensive quantity of points involved, and the last ones suffer from limitations in deformation flexibility and rendering efficiency. In response to these challenges, we propose MonoGaussianAvatar (Monocular Gaussian Point-based Head Avatar), a novel approach that harnesses 3D Gaussian point representation coupled with a Gaussian deformation field to learn explicit head avatars from monocular portrait videos. We define our head avatars with Gaussian points characterized by adaptable shapes, enabling flexible topology. These points exhibit movement with a Gaussian deformation field in alignment with the target pose and expression of a person, facilitating efficient deformation. Additionally, the Gaussian points have controllable shape, size, color, and opacity combined with Gaussian splatting, allowing for efficient training and rendering. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art results among previous methods.",

In this work, we present Relightable Gaussian Codec Avatars, a method to build high-fidelity relightable head avatars that can be animated to generate novel expressions. Our geometry model based on 3D Gaussians can capture 3D-consistent sub-millimeter details such as hair strands and pores on dynamic face sequences. To support diverse materials of human heads such as the eyes, skin, and hair in a unified manner, we present a novel relightable appearance model based on learnable radiance transfer. Together with global illumination-aware spherical harmonics for the diffuse components, we achieve real-time relighting with all-frequency reflections using spherical Gaussians. This appearance model can be efficiently relit under both point light and continuous illumination. We further improve the fidelity of eye reflections and enable explicit gaze control by introducing relightable explicit eye models. Our method outperforms existing approaches without compromising real-time performance. We also demonstrate real-time relighting of avatars on a tethered consumer VR headset, showcasing the efficiency and fidelity of our avatars.",

We first propose a dual-graph mechanism to obtain motion priors, with a coarse deformation graph for effective initialization and a fine-grained Gaussian graph to enforce subsequent constraints. Then, we utilize a 4D Gaussian optimization scheme with adaptive spatial-temporal regularizers to effectively balance the non-rigid prior and Gaussian updating. We also present a companion compression scheme with residual compensation for immersive experiences on various platforms. It achieves a substantial compression rate of approximately 25 times, with less than 2MB of storage per frame.

In contrast to the prevalent NeRF-based approaches hampered by slow training and rendering speeds, our approach harnesses recent advancements in point-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Specifically, a novel Dual-Domain Deformation Model (DDDM) is proposed to explicitly model attribute deformations of each Gaussian point, where the time-dependent residual of each attribute is captured by a polynomial fitting in the time domain, and a Fourier series fitting in the frequency domain. The proposed DDDM is capable of modeling complex scene deformations across long video footage, eliminating the need for training separate 3DGS for each frame or introducing an additional implicit neural field to model 3D dynamics. Moreover, the explicit deformation modeling for discretized Gaussian points ensures ultra-fast training and rendering of a 4D scene, which is comparable to the original 3DGS designed for static 3D reconstruction. Our proposed approach showcases a substantial efficiency improvement, achieving a $5\\times$ faster training speed compared to the per-frame 3DGS modeling. In addition, quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian-Flow significantly outperforms previous leading methods in novel view rendering quality.

    "abstract": "3D scene representations have gained immense popularity in recent years. Methods that use Neural Radiance fields are versatile for traditional tasks such as novel view synthesis. In recent times, some work has emerged that aims to extend the functionality of NeRF beyond view synthesis, for semantically aware tasks such as editing and segmentation using 3D feature field distillation from 2D foundation models. However, these methods have two major limitations: (a) they are limited by the rendering speed of NeRF pipelines, and (b) implicitly represented feature fields suffer from continuity artifacts reducing feature quality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown state-of-the-art performance on real-time radiance field rendering. In this work, we go one step further: in addition to radiance field rendering, we enable 3D Gaussian splatting on arbitrary-dimension semantic features via 2D foundation model distillation. This translation is not straightforward: naively incorporating feature fields in the 3DGS framework encounters significant challenges, notably the disparities in spatial resolution and channel consistency between RGB images and feature maps. We propose architectural and training changes to efficiently avert this problem. Our proposed method is general, and our experiments showcase novel view semantic segmentation, language-guided editing and segment anything through learning feature fields from state-of-the-art 2D foundation models such as SAM and CLIP-LSeg. Across experiments, our distillation method is able to provide comparable or better results, while being significantly faster to both train and render. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first method to enable point and bounding-box prompting for radiance field manipulation, by leveraging the SAM model.

The proposed approach leverages an implicit function representation of 3D human heads, employing 3D Gaussians anchored on a parametric face model. To enhance representational capabilities and encode spatial information, we embed a lightweight tri-plane payload within each Gaussian rather than directly storing color and opacity. Additionally, we parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV space via a 3DMM, enabling effective utilization of the diffusion model for 3D head avatar generation.

Specifically, GauHuman encodes Gaussian Splatting in the canonical space and transforms 3D Gaussians from canonical space to posed space with linear blend skinning (LBS), in which effective pose and LBS refinement modules are designed to learn fine details of 3D humans under negligible computational cost. Moreover, to enable fast optimization of GauHuman, we initialize and prune 3D Gaussians with 3D human prior, while splitting/cloning via KL divergence guidance, along with a novel merge operation for further speeding up. Extensive experiments on ZJU_Mocap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that GauHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance quantitatively and qualitatively with fast training and real-time rendering speed. Notably, without sacrificing rendering quality, GauHuman can fast model the 3D human performer with ~13k 3D Gaussians.",

In this paper, we propose HHAvatar represented by controllable 3D Gaussians for high-fidelity head avatar with dynamic hair modeling. We first use 3D Gaussians to represent the appearance of the head, and then jointly optimize neutral 3D Gaussians and a fully learned MLP-based deformation field to capture complex expressions. The two parts benefit each other, thereby our method can model fine-grained dynamic details while ensuring expression accuracy. Furthermore, we devise a well-designed geometry-guided initialization strategy based on implicit SDF and Deep Marching Tetrahedra for the stability and convergence of the training procedure. To address the problem of dynamic hair modeling, we introduce a hybrid head model into our avatar representation based Gaussian Head Avatar and a training method that considers timing information and an occlusion perception module to model the non-rigid motion of hair. Experiments show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art sparse-view methods, achieving ultra high-fidelity rendering quality at 2K resolution even under exaggerated expressions and driving hairs reasonably with the motion of the head",

We present MANUS, a method for Markerless Hand-Object Grasp Capture using Articulated 3D Gaussians. We build a novel articulated 3D Gaussians representation that extends 3D Gaussian splatting for high-fidelity representation of articulating hands. Since our representation uses Gaussian primitives, it enables us to efficiently and accurately estimate contacts between the hand and the object. For the most accurate results, our method requires tens of camera views that current datasets do not provide. We therefore build MANUS-Grasps, a new dataset that contains hand-object grasps viewed from 50+ cameras across 30+ scenes, 3 subjects, and comprising over 7M frames. In addition to extensive qualitative results, we also show that our method outperforms others on a quantitative contact evaluation method that uses paint transfer from the object to the hand.",

    "abstract": "Recent neural rendering and reconstruction techniques, such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splatting, have shown remarkable novel view synthesis capabilities but require hundreds of images of the scene from diverse viewpoints to render high-quality novel views. With fewer images available, these methods start to fail since they can no longer correctly triangulate the underlying 3D geometry and converge to a non-optimal solution. These failures can manifest as floaters or blurry renderings in sparsely observed areas of the scene. In this paper, we propose Re-Nerfing, a simple and general add-on approach that leverages novel view synthesis itself to tackle this problem. Using an already trained NVS method, we render novel views between existing ones and augment the training data to optimize a second model. This introduces additional multi-view constraints and allows the second model to converge to a better solution. With Re-Nerfing we achieve significant improvements upon multiple pipelines based on NeRF and Gaussian-Splatting in sparse view settings of the mip-NeRF 360 and LLFF datasets. Notably, Re-Nerfing does not require prior knowledge or extra supervision signals, making it a flexible and practical add-on.",

SplaTAM employs a simple online tracking and mapping system tailored to the underlying Gaussian representation. It utilizes a silhouette mask to elegantly capture the presence of scene density. This combination enables several benefits over prior representations, including fast rendering and dense optimization, quickly determining if areas have been previously mapped, and structured map expansion by adding more Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that SplaTAM achieves up to 2x superior performance in camera pose estimation, map construction, and novel-view synthesis over existing methods, paving the way for more immersive high-fidelity SLAM applications.",

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes is still a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Recently, Gaussian splatting has emerged as a robust technique to represent static scenes and enable high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. Building upon this technique, we propose a new representation that explicitly decomposes the motion and appearance of dynamic scenes into sparse control points and dense Gaussians, respectively. Our key idea is to use sparse control points, significantly fewer in number than the Gaussians, to learn compact 6 DoF transformation bases, which can be locally interpolated through learned interpolation weights to yield the motion field of 3D Gaussians. We employ a deformation MLP to predict time-varying 6 DoF transformations for each control point, which reduces learning complexities, enhances learning abilities, and facilitates obtaining temporal and spatial coherent motion patterns. Then, we jointly learn the 3D Gaussians, the canonical space locations of control points, and the deformation MLP to reconstruct the appearance, geometry, and dynamics of 3D scenes. During learning, the location and number of control points are adaptively adjusted to accommodate varying motion complexities in different regions, and an ARAP loss following the principle of as rigid as possible is developed to enforce spatial continuity and local rigidity of learned motions. Finally, thanks to the explicit sparse motion representation and its decomposition from appearance, our method can enable user-controlled motion editing while retaining high-fidelity appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing approaches on novel view synthesis with a high rendering speed and enables novel appearance-preserved motion editing applications.

Rather than modeling many feature scales separately (as done previously), we use the inverse discrete wavelet transform to reconstruct features at varying scales. This leads to a more compact representation and allows us to explore wavelet-based compression schemes for further gains. The proposed compression scheme exploits the sparsity of wavelet coefficients, by applying hard thresholding to the wavelet planes and storing nonzero coefficients and their locations on each plane in a Hash Map. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SotA), WavePlanes is significantly smaller, less resource demanding and competitive in reconstruction quality.

    "abstract": "We propose FlashAvatar, a novel and lightweight 3D animatable avatar representation that could reconstruct a digital avatar from a short monocular video sequence in minutes and render high-fidelity photo-realistic images at 300FPS on a consumer-grade GPU. To achieve this, we maintain a uniform 3D Gaussian field embedded in the surface of a parametric face model and learn extra spatial offset to model non-surface regions and subtle facial details. While full use of geometric priors can capture high-frequency facial details and preserve exaggerated expressions, proper initialization can help reduce the number of Gaussians, thus enabling super-fast rendering speed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FlashAvatar outperforms existing works regarding visual quality and personalized details and is almost an order of magnitude faster in rendering speed.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic objects from monocular videos is a severely underconstrained and challenging problem, and recent work has approached it in various directions. However, owing to the ill-posed nature of this problem, there has been no solution that can provide consistent, high-quality novel views from camera positions that are significantly different from the training views. In this work, we introduce Neural Parametric Gaussians (NPGs) to take on this challenge by imposing a two-stage approach: first, we fit a low-rank neural deformation model, which then is used as regularization for non-rigid reconstruction in the second stage. The first stage learns the object's deformations such that it preserves consistency in novel views. The second stage obtains high reconstruction quality by optimizing 3D Gaussians that are driven by the coarse model. To this end, we introduce a local 3D Gaussian representation, where temporally shared Gaussians are anchored in and deformed by local oriented volumes. The resulting combined model can be rendered as radiance fields, resulting in high-quality photo-realistic reconstructions of the non-rigidly deforming objects. We demonstrate that NPGs achieve superior results compared to previous works, especially in challenging scenarios with few multi-view cues.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of text-to-3D generation, utilizing 2D diffusion models through score distillation sampling (SDS) frequently leads to issues such as blurred appearances and multi-faced geometry, primarily due to the intrinsically noisy nature of the SDS loss. Our analysis identifies the core of these challenges as the interaction among noise levels in the 2D diffusion process, the architecture of the diffusion network, and the 3D model representation. To overcome these limitations, we present StableDreamer, a methodology incorporating three advances. First, inspired by InstructNeRF2NeRF, we formalize the equivalence of the SDS generative prior and a simple supervised L2 reconstruction loss. This finding provides a novel tool to debug SDS, which we use to show the impact of time-annealing noise levels on reducing multi-faced geometries. Second, our analysis shows that while image-space diffusion contributes to geometric precision, latent-space diffusion is crucial for vivid color rendition. Based on this observation, StableDreamer introduces a two-stage training strategy that effectively combines these aspects, resulting in high-fidelity 3D models. Third, we adopt an anisotropic 3D Gaussians representation, replacing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), to enhance the overall quality, reduce memory usage during training, and accelerate rendering speeds, and better capture semi-transparent objects. StableDreamer reduces multi-face geometries, generates fine details, and converges stably.",

    "abstract": "Differentiable rendering is a technique used in an important emerging class of visual computing applications that involves representing a 3D scene as a model that is trained from 2D images using gradient descent. Recent works (e.g. 3D Gaussian Splatting) use a rasterization pipeline to enable rendering high quality photo-realistic imagery at high speeds from these learned 3D models. These methods have been demonstrated to be very promising, providing state-of-art quality for many important tasks. However, training a model to represent a scene is still a time-consuming task even when using powerful GPUs. In this work, we observe that the gradient computation phase during training is a significant bottleneck on GPUs due to the large number of atomic operations that need to be processed. These atomic operations overwhelm atomic units in the L2 partitions causing stalls. To address this challenge, we leverage the observations that during the gradient computation: (1) for most warps, all threads atomically update the same memory locations; and (2) warps generate varying amounts of atomic traffic (since some threads may be inactive). We propose DISTWAR, a software-approach to accelerate atomic operations based on two key ideas: First, we enable warp-level reduction of threads at the SM sub-cores using registers to leverage the locality in intra-warp atomic updates. Second, we distribute the atomic computation between the warp-level reduction at the SM and the L2 atomic units to increase the throughput of atomic computation. Warps with many threads performing atomic updates to the same memory locations are scheduled at the SM, and the rest using L2 atomic units. We implement DISTWAR using existing warp-level primitives. We evaluate DISTWAR on widely used raster-based differentiable rendering workloads. We demonstrate significant speedups of 2.44x on average (up to 5.7x).",

Given 2D visual prompts as input, SAGA can segment the corresponding 3D target represented by 3D Gaussians within 4 ms. This is achieved by attaching an scale-gated affinity feature to each 3D Gaussian to endow it a new property towards multi-granularity segmentation. Specifically, a scale-aware contrastive training strategy is proposed for the scale-gated affinity feature learning. It 1) distills the segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) from 2D masks into the affinity features and 2) employs a soft scale gate mechanism to deal with multi-granularity ambiguity in 3D segmentation through adjusting the magnitude of each feature channel according to a specified 3D physical scale. Evaluations demonstrate that SAGA achieves real-time multi-granularity segmentation with quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods. As one of the first methods addressing promptable segmentation in 3D-GS, the simplicity and effectiveness of SAGA pave the way for future advancements in this field. Our code will be released.",

We augment each Gaussian with a compact Identity Encoding, allowing the Gaussians to be grouped according to their object instance or stuff membership in the 3D scene. Instead of resorting to expensive 3D labels, we supervise the Identity Encodings during the differentiable rendering by leveraging the 2D mask predictions by Segment Anything Model (SAM), along with introduced 3D spatial consistency regularization. Compared to the implicit NeRF representation, we show that the discrete and grouped 3D Gaussians can reconstruct, segment and edit anything in 3D with high visual quality, fine granularity and efficiency.

To address this challenge, we propose a few-shot view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables real-time and photo-realistic view synthesis with as few as three training views. The proposed method, dubbed FSGS, handles the extremely sparse initialized SfM points with a thoughtfully designed Gaussian Unpooling process. Our method iteratively distributes new Gaussians around the most representative locations, subsequently infilling local details in vacant areas. We also integrate a large-scale pre-trained monocular depth estimator within the Gaussians optimization process, leveraging online augmented views to guide the geometric optimization towards an optimal solution. Starting from sparse points observed from limited input viewpoints, our FSGS can accurately grow into unseen regions, comprehensively covering the scene and boosting the rendering quality of novel views. Overall, FSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and rendering efficiency across diverse datasets, including LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, and Blender.

    "abstract": "Existing neural implicit surface reconstruction methods have achieved impressive performance in multi-view 3D reconstruction by leveraging explicit geometry priors such as depth maps or point clouds as regularization. However, the reconstruction results still lack fine details because of the over-smoothed depth map or sparse point cloud. In this work, we propose a neural implicit surface reconstruction pipeline with guidance from 3D Gaussian Splatting to recover highly detailed surfaces. The advantage of 3D Gaussian Splatting is that it can generate dense point clouds with detailed structure. Nonetheless, a naive adoption of 3D Gaussian Splatting can fail since the generated points are the centers of 3D Gaussians that do not necessarily lie on the surface. We thus introduce a scale regularizer to pull the centers close to the surface by enforcing the 3D Gaussians to be extremely thin. Moreover, we propose to refine the point cloud from 3D Gaussians Splatting with the normal priors from the surface predicted by neural implicit models instead of using a fixed set of points as guidance. Consequently, the quality of surface reconstruction improves from the guidance of the more accurate 3D Gaussian splatting. By jointly optimizing the 3D Gaussian Splatting and the neural implicit model, our approach benefits from both representations and generates complete surfaces with intricate details. Experiments on Tanks and Temples verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

A recent advance, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), leverages an explicit representation to achieve real-time rendering with high-quality results. However, 3DGS still requires an abundance of training views to generate a coherent scene representation. In few shot settings, similar to NeRF, 3DGS tends to overfit to training views, causing background collapse and excessive floaters, especially as the number of training views are reduced. We propose a method to enable training coherent 3DGS-based radiance fields of 360-degree scenes from sparse training views. We integrate depth priors with generative and explicit constraints to reduce background collapse, remove floaters, and enhance consistency from unseen viewpoints. Experiments show that our method outperforms base 3DGS by 6.4% in LPIPS and by 12.2% in PSNR, and NeRF-based methods by at least 17.6% in LPIPS on the MipNeRF-360 dataset with substantially less training and inference cost.",

To address these challenges, we propose DynMF, a compact and efficient representation that decomposes a dynamic scene into a few neural trajectories. We argue that the per-point motions of a dynamic scene can be decomposed into a small set of explicit or learned trajectories. Our carefully designed neural framework consisting of a tiny set of learned basis queried only in time allows for rendering speed similar to 3D Gaussian Splatting, surpassing 120 FPS, while at the same time, requiring only double the storage compared to static scenes. Our neural representation adequately constrains the inherently underconstrained motion field of a dynamic scene leading to effective and fast optimization. This is done by biding each point to motion coefficients that enforce the per-point sharing of basis trajectories. By carefully applying a sparsity loss to the motion coefficients, we are able to disentangle the motions that comprise the scene, independently control them, and generate novel motion combinations that have never been seen before. We can reach state-of-the-art render quality within just 5 minutes of training and in less than half an hour, we can synthesize novel views of dynamic scenes with superior photorealistic quality. Our representation is interpretable, efficient, and expressive enough to offer real-time view synthesis of complex dynamic scene motions, in monocular and multi-view scenarios.",

While remarkable progress has been made for rigid object manipulation, manipulating deformable objects poses unique challenges, including frequent occlusions, infinite-dimensional state spaces and complex dynamics. Just as object pose estimation and tracking have aided robots for rigid manipulation, dense 3D tracking (scene flow) of highly deformable objects will enable new applications in robotics while aiding existing approaches, such as imitation learning or creating digital twins with real2sim transfer. We propose DeformGS, an approach to recover scene flow in highly deformable scenes, using simultaneous video captures of a dynamic scene from multiple cameras. DeformGS builds on recent advances in Gaussian splatting, a method that learns the properties of a large number of Gaussians for state-of-the-art and fast novel-view synthesis. DeformGS learns a deformation function to project a set of Gaussians with canonical properties into world space. The deformation function uses a neural-voxel encoding and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to infer Gaussian position, rotation, and a shadow scalar. We enforce physics-inspired regularization terms based on conservation of momentum and isometry, which leads to trajectories with smaller trajectory errors. We also leverage existing foundation models SAM and XMEM to produce noisy masks, and learn a per-Gaussian mask for better physics-inspired regularization. DeformGS achieves high-quality 3D tracking on highly deformable scenes with shadows and occlusions. In experiments, DeformGS improves 3D tracking by an average of 55.8% compared to the state-of-the-art. With sufficient texture, DeformGS achieves a median tracking error of 3.3 mm on a cloth of 1.5 x 1.5 m in area. Website: https://deformgs.github.io",

Consequently, the resulting model becomes less robust to significant view changes, texture-less area and lighting effects. We introduce Scaffold-GS, which uses anchor points to distribute local 3D Gaussians, and predicts their attributes on-the-fly based on viewing direction and distance within the view frustum. Anchor growing and pruning strategies are developed based on the importance of neural Gaussians to reliably improve the scene coverage.

    "abstract": "Modeling dynamic, large-scale urban scenes is challenging due to their highly intricate geometric structures and unconstrained dynamics in both space and time. Prior methods often employ high-level architectural priors, separating static and dynamic elements, resulting in suboptimal capture of their synergistic interactions. To address this challenge, we present a unified representation model, called Periodic Vibration Gaussian (PVG). PVG builds upon the efficient 3D Gaussian splatting technique, originally designed for static scene representation, by introducing periodic vibration-based temporal dynamics. This innovation enables PVG to elegantly and uniformly represent the characteristics of various objects and elements in dynamic urban scenes. To enhance temporally coherent and large scene representation learning with sparse training data, we introduce a novel temporal smoothing mechanism and a position-aware adaptive control strategy respectively. Extensive experiments on Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI benchmarks demonstrate that PVG surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in both reconstruction and novel view synthesis for both dynamic and static scenes. Notably, PVG achieves this without relying on manually labeled object bounding boxes or expensive optical flow estimation. Moreover, PVG exhibits 900-fold acceleration in rendering over the best alternative.",

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary querying in 3D space is challenging but essential for scene understanding tasks such as object localization and segmentation. Language-embedded scene representations have made progress by incorporating language features into 3D spaces. However, their efficacy heavily depends on neural networks that are resource-intensive in training and rendering. Although recent 3D Gaussians offer efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis, directly embedding language features in them leads to prohibitive memory usage and decreased performance. In this work, we introduce Language Embedded 3D Gaussians, a novel scene representation for open-vocabulary query tasks. Instead of embedding high-dimensional raw semantic features on 3D Gaussians, we propose a dedicated quantization scheme that drastically alleviates the memory requirement, and a novel embedding procedure that achieves smoother yet high accuracy query, countering the multi-view feature inconsistencies and the high-frequency inductive bias in point-based representations. Our comprehensive experiments show that our representation achieves the best visual quality and language querying accuracy across current language-embedded representations, while maintaining real-time rendering frame rates on a single desktop GPU.",

However, it comes with a drawback in the much larger storage demand compared to NeRF methods since it needs to store the parameters for several 3D Gaussians. We notice that many Gaussians may share similar parameters, so we introduce a simple vector quantization method based on K-means to quantize the Gaussian parameters while optimizing them. Then, we store the small codebook along with the index of the code for each Gaussian. We compress the indices further by sorting them and using a method similar to run-length encoding. Moreover, we use a simple regularizer to encourage zero opacity (invisible Gaussians) to reduce the storage and rendering time by a large factor through reducing the number of Gaussians. We do extensive experiments on standard benchmarks as well as an existing 3D dataset that is an order of magnitude larger than the standard benchmarks used in this field. We show that our simple yet effective method can reduce the storage cost for 3DGS by 40 to 50x and rendering time by 2 to 3x with a very small drop in the quality of rendered images.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neural rendering have improved both training and rendering times by orders of magnitude. While these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art quality and speed, they are designed for photogrammetry of static scenes and do not generalize well to freely moving humans in the environment. In this work, we introduce Human Gaussian Splats (HUGS) that represents an animatable human together with the scene using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method takes only a monocular video with a small number of (50-100) frames, and it automatically learns to disentangle the static scene and a fully animatable human avatar within 30 minutes. We utilize the SMPL body model to initialize the human Gaussians. To capture details that are not modeled by SMPL (e.g. cloth, hairs), we allow the 3D Gaussians to deviate from the human body model. Utilizing 3D Gaussians for animated humans brings new challenges, including the artifacts created when articulating the Gaussians. We propose to jointly optimize the linear blend skinning weights to coordinate the movements of individual Gaussians during animation. Our approach enables novel-pose synthesis of human and novel view synthesis of both the human and the scene. We achieve state-of-the-art rendering quality with a rendering speed of 60 FPS while being ~100x faster to train over previous work.

In this work, we propose CG3D, a method for compositionally generating scalable 3D assets that resolves these constraints. We find that explicit Gaussian radiance fields, parameterized to allow for compositions of objects, possess the capability to enable semantically and physically consistent scenes.

Current 3D GAN architectures, however, typically rely on volume representations, which are slow to render, thereby hampering the GAN training and requiring multi-view-inconsistent 2D upsamplers. Here, we introduce Gaussian Shell Maps (GSMs) as a framework that connects SOTA generator network architectures with emerging 3D Gaussian rendering primitives using an articulable multi shell--based scaffold. In this setting, a CNN generates a 3D texture stack with features that are mapped to the shells. The latter represent inflated and deflated versions of a template surface of a digital human in a canonical body pose. Instead of rasterizing the shells directly, we sample 3D Gaussians on the shells whose attributes are encoded in the texture features. These Gaussians are efficiently and differentiably rendered. The ability to articulate the shells is important during GAN training and, at inference time, to deform a body into arbitrary user-defined poses. Our efficient rendering scheme bypasses the need for view-inconsistent upsamplers and achieves high-quality multi-view consistent renderings at a native resolution of $512 \\times 512$ pixels. We demonstrate that GSMs successfully generate 3D humans when trained on single-view datasets, including SHHQ and DeepFashion.",

In this paper, we present GaussianShader, a novel method that applies a simplified shading function on 3D Gaussians to enhance the neural rendering in scenes with reflective surfaces while preserving the training and rendering efficiency. The main challenge in applying the shading function lies in the accurate normal estimation on discrete 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we proposed a novel normal estimation framework based on the shortest axis directions of 3D Gaussians with a delicately designed loss to make the consistency between the normals and the geometries of Gaussian spheres. Experiments show that GaussianShader strikes a commendable balance between efficiency and visual quality. Our method surpasses Gaussian Splatting in PSNR on specular object datasets, exhibiting an improvement of 1.57dB.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in real-time neural rendering using point-based techniques have enabled broader adoption of 3D representations. However, foundational approaches like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose substantial storage overhead, as Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points can grow to millions, often requiring gigabyte-level disk space for a single unbounded scene. This growth presents scalability challenges and hinders splatting efficiency. To address this, we introduce LightGaussian, a method for transforming 3D Gaussians into a more compact format. Inspired by Network Pruning, LightGaussian identifies Gaussians with minimal global significance on scene reconstruction, and applies a pruning and recovery process to reduce redundancy while preserving visual quality. Knowledge distillation and pseudo-view augmentation then transfer spherical harmonic coefficients to a lower degree, yielding compact representations. Gaussian Vector Quantization, based on each Gaussian's global significance, further lowers bitwidth with minimal accuracy loss. LightGaussian achieves an average 15x compression rate while boosting FPS from 144 to 237 within the 3D-GS framework, enabling efficient complex scene representation on the Mip-NeRF 360 and Tank & Temple datasets. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is also adaptable to other 3D representations (e.g., Scaffold-GS), demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.",

Existing methods optimize 3D representations like mesh or neural fields via score distillation sampling (SDS), which suffers from inadequate fine details or excessive training time. In this paper, we propose an efficient yet effective framework, HumanGaussian, that generates high-quality 3D humans with fine-grained geometry and realistic appearance. Our key insight is that 3D Gaussian Splatting is an efficient renderer with periodic Gaussian shrinkage or growing, where such adaptive density control can be naturally guided by intrinsic human structures. Specifically, 1) we first propose a Structure-Aware SDS that simultaneously optimizes human appearance and geometry. The multi-modal score function from both RGB and depth space is leveraged to distill the Gaussian densification and pruning process. 2) Moreover, we devise an Annealed Negative Prompt Guidance by decomposing SDS into a noisier generative score and a cleaner classifier score, which well addresses the over-saturation issue. The floating artifacts are further eliminated based on Gaussian size in a prune-only phase to enhance generation smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and competitive quality of our framework, rendering vivid 3D humans under diverse scenarios.

While the classical approaches to model and render virtual humans generally use a textured mesh, recent research has developed neural body representations that achieve impressive visual quality. However, these models are difficult to render in real-time and their quality degrades when the character is animated with body poses different than the training observations. We propose an animatable human model based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, that has recently emerged as a very efficient alternative to neural radiance fields. The body is represented by a set of gaussian primitives in a canonical space which is deformed with a coarse to fine approach that combines forward skinning and local non-rigid refinement. We describe how to learn our Human Gaussian Splatting (HuGS) model in an end-to-end fashion from multi-view observations, and evaluate it against the state-of-the-art approaches for novel pose synthesis of clothed body.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussians have recently emerged as a highly efficient representation for 3D reconstruction and rendering. Despite its high rendering quality and speed at high resolutions, they both deteriorate drastically when rendered at lower resolutions or from far away camera position. During low resolution or far away rendering, the pixel size of the image can fall below the Nyquist frequency compared to the screen size of each splatted 3D Gaussian and leads to aliasing effect. The rendering is also drastically slowed down by the sequential alpha blending of more splatted Gaussians per pixel. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm, which maintains Gaussians at different scales to represent the same scene. Higher-resolution images are rendered with more small Gaussians, and lower-resolution images are rendered with fewer larger Gaussians.

To associate 3D Gaussians with the animatable avatar, we learn a parametric template from the input videos, and then parameterize the template on two front & back canonical Gaussian maps where each pixel represents a 3D Gaussian. The learned template is adaptive to the wearing garments for modeling looser clothes like dresses. Such template-guided 2D parameterization enables us to employ a powerful StyleGAN-based CNN to learn the pose-dependent Gaussian maps for modeling detailed dynamic appearances. Furthermore, we introduce a pose projection strategy for better generalization given novel poses. To tackle the realistic relighting of animatable avatars, we introduce physically-based rendering into the avatar representation for decomposing avatar materials and environment illumination. Overall, our method can create lifelike avatars with dynamic, realistic, generalized and relightable appearances. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.",

However, current diffusion models primarily generate images by predicting noise in the latent space, and the editing is usually applied to the whole image, which makes it challenging to perform delicate, especially localized, editing for 3D scenes. Inspired by recent 3D Gaussian splatting, we propose a systematic framework, named GaussianEditor, to edit 3D scenes delicately via 3D Gaussians with text instructions. Benefiting from the explicit property of 3D Gaussians, we design a series of techniques to achieve delicate editing. Specifically, we first extract the region of interest (RoI) corresponding to the text instruction, aligning it to 3D Gaussians. The Gaussian RoI is further used to control the editing process. Our framework can achieve more delicate and precise editing of 3D scenes than previous methods while enjoying much faster training speed, i.e. within 20 minutes on a single V100 GPU, more than twice as fast as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (45 minutes -- 2 hours).",

However, strong artifacts can be observed when changing the sampling rate, \\eg, by changing focal length or camera distance. We find that the source for this phenomenon can be attributed to the lack of 3D frequency constraints and the usage of a 2D dilation filter. To address this problem, we introduce a 3D smoothing filter which constrains the size of the 3D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling frequency induced by the input views, eliminating high-frequency artifacts when zooming in. Moreover, replacing 2D dilation with a 2D Mip filter, which simulates a 2D box filter, effectively mitigates aliasing and dilation issues. Our evaluation, including scenarios such a training on single-scale images and testing on multiple scales, validates the effectiveness of our approach.",

There are two main problems when introducing GS to inverse rendering: 1) GS does not support producing plausible normal natively; 2) forward mapping (e.g. rasterization and splatting) cannot trace the occlusion like backward mapping (e.g. ray tracing). To address these challenges, our GS-IR proposes an efficient optimization scheme that incorporates a depth-derivation-based regularization for normal estimation and a baking-based occlusion to model indirect lighting. The flexible and expressive GS representation allows us to achieve fast and compact geometry reconstruction, photorealistic novel view synthesis, and effective physically-based rendering.

    "abstract": "3D editing plays a crucial role in many areas such as gaming and virtual reality. Traditional 3D editing methods, which rely on representations like meshes and point clouds, often fall short in realistically depicting complex scenes. On the other hand, methods based on implicit 3D representations, like Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), render complex scenes effectively but suffer from slow processing speeds and limited control over specific scene areas. In response to these challenges, our paper presents GaussianEditor, an innovative and efficient 3D editing algorithm based on Gaussian Splatting (GS), a novel 3D representation. GaussianEditor enhances precision and control in editing through our proposed Gaussian semantic tracing, which traces the editing target throughout the training process. Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Gaussian splatting (HGS) to achieve stabilized and fine results under stochastic generative guidance from 2D diffusion models. We also develop editing strategies for efficient object removal and integration, a challenging task for existing methods. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate GaussianEditor's superior control, efficacy, and rapid performance, marking a significant advancement in 3D editing.

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in capturing complex 3D scenes with high fidelity. However, one persistent challenge that hinders the widespread adoption of NeRFs is the computational bottleneck due to the volumetric rendering. On the other hand, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an alternative representation that leverages a 3D Gaussisan-based representation and adopts the rasterization pipeline to render the images rather than volumetric rendering, achieving very fast rendering speed and promising image quality. However, a significant drawback arises as 3DGS entails a substantial number of 3D Gaussians to maintain the high fidelity of the rendered images, which requires a large amount of memory and storage. To address this critical issue, we place a specific emphasis on two key objectives: reducing the number of Gaussian points without sacrificing performance and compressing the Gaussian attributes, such as view-dependent color and covariance. To this end, we propose a learnable mask strategy that significantly reduces the number of Gaussians while preserving high performance. In addition, we propose a compact but effective representation of view-dependent color by employing a grid-based neural field rather than relying on spherical harmonics. Finally, we learn codebooks to compactly represent the geometric attributes of Gaussian by vector quantization. With model compression techniques such as quantization and entropy coding, we consistently show over 25$\\times$ reduced storage and enhanced rendering speed, while maintaining the quality of the scene representation, compared to 3DGS. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for 3D scene representation, achieving high performance, fast training, compactness, and real-time rendering.

Compared to existing NeRF-based methods, the model owns better capability in synthesizing high-frequency details without the jittering problem across video frames. The core of our model is a novel augmented 3D Gaussian representation, which attaches each Gaussian with a learnable code. The learnable code serves as a pose-dependent appearance embedding for refining the erroneous appearance caused by geometric transformation of Gaussians, based on which an appearance refinement model is learned to produce residual Gaussian properties to match the appearance in target pose. To force the Gaussians to learn the foreground human only without background interference, we further design a novel alpha loss to explicitly constrain the Gaussians within the human body. We also propose to jointly optimize the human joint parameters to improve the appearance accuracy. The animatable 3D Gaussian model can be learned with shallow MLPs, so new human motions can be synthesized in real time (66 fps on avarage). Experiments show that our model has superior performance over NeRF-based methods.",

To address this issue, we introduce a dense depth map as a geometry guide to mitigate overfitting. We obtained the depth map using a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model and aligning the scale and offset using sparse COLMAP feature points. The adjusted depth aids in the color-based optimization of 3D Gaussian splatting, mitigating floating artifacts, and ensuring adherence to geometric constraints. We verify the proposed method on the NeRF-LLFF dataset with varying numbers of few images. Our approach demonstrates robust geometry compared to the original method that relies solely on images.

Existing 3D scene generation models, however, limit the target scene to specific domain, primarily due to their training strategies using 3D scan dataset that is far from the real-world. To address such limitation, we propose LucidDreamer, a domain-free scene generation pipeline by fully leveraging the power of existing large-scale diffusion-based generative model. Our LucidDreamer has two alternate steps: Dreaming and Alignment. First, to generate multi-view consistent images from inputs, we set the point cloud as a geometrical guideline for each image generation. Specifically, we project a portion of point cloud to the desired view and provide the projection as a guidance for inpainting using the generative model. The inpainted images are lifted to 3D space with estimated depth maps, composing a new points. Second, to aggregate the new points into the 3D scene, we propose an aligning algorithm which harmoniously integrates the portions of newly generated 3D scenes. The finally obtained 3D scene serves as initial points for optimizing Gaussian splats. LucidDreamer produces Gaussian splats that are highly-detailed compared to the previous 3D scene generation methods, with no constraint on domain of the target scene.

    "abstract": "We propose a method to allow precise and extremely fast mesh extraction from 3D Gaussian Splatting. Gaussian Splatting has recently become very popular as it yields realistic rendering while being significantly faster to train than NeRFs. It is however challenging to extract a mesh from the millions of tiny 3D gaussians as these gaussians tend to be unorganized after optimization and no method has been proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a regularization term that encourages the gaussians to align well with the surface of the scene. We then introduce a method that exploits this alignment to extract a mesh from the Gaussians using Poisson reconstruction, which is fast, scalable, and preserves details, in contrast to the Marching Cubes algorithm usually applied to extract meshes from Neural SDFs. Finally, we introduce an optional refinement strategy that binds gaussians to the surface of the mesh, and jointly optimizes these Gaussians and the mesh through Gaussian splatting rendering. This enables easy editing, sculpting, rigging, animating, compositing and relighting of the Gaussians using traditional softwares by manipulating the mesh instead of the gaussians themselves. Retrieving such an editable mesh for realistic rendering is done within minutes with our method, compared to hours with the state-of-the-art methods on neural SDFs, while providing a better rendering quality.

Employing a custom Material Point Method (MPM), our approach enriches 3D Gaussian kernels with physically meaningful kinematic deformation and mechanical stress attributes, all evolved in line with continuum mechanics principles. A defining characteristic of our method is the seamless integration between physical simulation and visual rendering: both components utilize the same 3D Gaussian kernels as their discrete representations. This negates the necessity for triangle/tetrahedron meshing, marching cubes, \"cage meshes,\" or any other geometry embedding, highlighting the principle of \"what you see is what you simulate (WS$^2$).\" Our method demonstrates exceptional versatility across a wide variety of materials--including elastic entities, metals, non-Newtonian fluids, and granular materials--showcasing its strong capabilities in creating diverse visual content with novel viewpoints and movements.

It facilitates a better balance between efficiency and accuracy. Compared to recent SLAM methods employing neural implicit representations, our method utilizes a real-time differentiable splatting rendering pipeline that offers significant speedup to map optimization and RGB-D rendering. Specifically, we propose an adaptive expansion strategy that adds new or deletes noisy 3D Gaussians in order to efficiently reconstruct new observed scene geometry and improve the mapping of previously observed areas. This strategy is essential to extend 3D Gaussian representation to reconstruct the whole scene rather than synthesize a static object in existing methods. Moreover, in the pose tracking process, an effective coarse-to-fine technique is designed to select reliable 3D Gaussian representations to optimize camera pose, resulting in runtime reduction and robust estimation. Our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art real-time methods on the Replica, TUM-RGBD datasets. Project page: https://gs-slam.github.io/.",

While recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have shown promise, they often fall short in rendering detailed and high-quality 3D models. This problem is especially prevalent as many methods base themselves on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). This paper identifies a notable deficiency in SDS, that it brings inconsistent and low-quality updating direction for the 3D model, causing the over-smoothing effect. To address this, we propose a novel approach called Interval Score Matching (ISM). ISM employs deterministic diffusing trajectories and utilizes interval-based score matching to counteract over-smoothing. Furthermore, we incorporate 3D Gaussian Splatting into our text-to-3D generation pipeline. Extensive experiments show that our model largely outperforms the state-of-the-art in quality and training efficiency.",

However, the pixel-wise rendering of NeRF and its ray marching light sampling constrain the rendering speed, impacting its utility in downstream industrial applications. Gaussian Splatting has recently shown a trend of replacing the traditional pointwise sampling technique commonly used in NeRF-based methodologies, and it is changing various aspects of 3D reconstruction. This paper introduces a novel text to 3D content generation framework, Gaussian Diffusion, based on Gaussian Splatting and produces more realistic renderings. The challenge of achieving multi-view consistency in 3D generation significantly impedes modeling complexity and accuracy. Taking inspiration from SJC, we explore employing multi-view noise distributions to perturb images generated by 3D Gaussian Splatting, aiming to rectify inconsistencies in multi-view geometry. We ingeniously devise an efficient method to generate noise that produces Gaussian noise from diverse viewpoints, all originating from a shared noise source. Furthermore, vanilla 3D Gaussian-based generation tends to trap models in local minima, causing artifacts like floaters, burrs, or proliferative elements. To mitigate these issues, we propose the variational Gaussian Splatting technique to enhance the quality and stability of 3D appearance. To our knowledge, our approach represents the first comprehensive utilization of Gaussian Diffusion across the entire spectrum of 3D content generation processes.",

Our approach represents the human as a set of 3D Gaussians within a canonical space, whose articulation is defined by extending the skinning of the underlying SMPL geometry to arbitrary locations in the canonical space. To account for pose-dependent effects, we introduce a SE(3) field, which allows us to capture both the location and anisotropy of the Gaussians. Furthermore, we propose the use of a neural color field to provide color regularization and 3D supervision for the precise positioning of these Gaussians. We show that Gaussian splatting provides an interesting alternative to neural rendering based methods by leverging a rasterization primitive without facing any of the non-differentiability and optimization challenges typically faced in such approaches. The rasterization paradigms allows us to leverage forward skinning, and does not suffer from the ambiguities associated with inverse skinning and warping. We show compelling results on the ZJU MoCap and People Snapshot datasets, which underscore the effectiveness of our method for controllable human synthesis.",

This work uses the recently presented 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to render realistic humans at real-time framerates, using dense calibrated multi-view videos as input. To deform those primitives, we depart from the commonly used point deformation method of linear blend skinning (LBS) and use a classic volumetric deformation method: cage deformations. Given their smaller size, we drive these deformations with joint angles and keypoints, which are more suitable for communication applications. Our experiments on nine subjects with varied body shapes, clothes, and motions obtain higher-quality results than state-of-the-art methods when using the same training and test data.",

Reliable movement analysis of infants and neonates is important as spontaneous movement behavior is an important indicator of neurological function and neurodevelopmental disability, which can help guide early interventions. We explored the application of dynamic Gaussian splatting to sparse markerless motion capture (MMC) data. Our approach leverages semantic segmentation masks to focus on the infant, significantly improving the initialization of the scene.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from 2D images and generating diverse views over time is challenging due to scene complexity and temporal dynamics. Despite advancements in neural implicit models, limitations persist: (i) Inadequate Scene Structure: Existing methods struggle to reveal the spatial and temporal structure of dynamic scenes from directly learning the complex 6D plenoptic function. (ii) Scaling Deformation Modeling: Explicitly modeling scene element deformation becomes impractical for complex dynamics. To address these issues, we consider the spacetime as an entirety and propose to approximate the underlying spatio-temporal 4D volume of a dynamic scene by optimizing a collection of 4D primitives, with explicit geometry and appearance modeling. Learning to optimize the 4D primitives enables us to synthesize novel views at any desired time with our tailored rendering routine. Our model is conceptually simple, consisting of a 4D Gaussian parameterized by anisotropic ellipses that can rotate arbitrarily in space and time, as well as view-dependent and time-evolved appearance represented by the coefficient of 4D spherindrical harmonics. This approach offers simplicity, flexibility for variable-length video and end-to-end training, and efficient real-time rendering, making it suitable for capturing complex dynamic scene motions. Experiments across various benchmarks, including monocular and multi-view scenarios, demonstrate our 4DGS model's superior visual quality and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Automatic text-to-3D generation that combines Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with the optimization of volume rendering has achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing realistic 3D objects. Yet most existing text-to-3D methods by SDS and volume rendering suffer from inaccurate geometry, e.g., the Janus issue, since it is hard to explicitly integrate 3D priors into implicit 3D representations. Besides, it is usually time-consuming for them to generate elaborate 3D models with rich colors. In response, this paper proposes GSGEN, a novel method that adopts Gaussian Splatting, a recent state-of-the-art representation, to text-to-3D generation. GSGEN aims at generating high-quality 3D objects and addressing existing shortcomings by exploiting the explicit nature of Gaussian Splatting that enables the incorporation of 3D prior. Specifically, our method adopts a progressive optimization strategy, which includes a geometry optimization stage and an appearance refinement stage. In geometry optimization, a coarse representation is established under 3D point cloud diffusion prior along with the ordinary 2D SDS optimization, ensuring a sensible and 3D-consistent rough shape. Subsequently, the obtained Gaussians undergo an iterative appearance refinement to enrich texture details. In this stage, we increase the number of Gaussians by compactness-based densification to enhance continuity and improve fidelity. With these designs, our approach can generate 3D assets with delicate details and accurate geometry. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially for capturing high-frequency components. Our code is available at https://github.com/gsgen3d/gsgen",

To address the issues, we propose a deformable 3D Gaussians Splatting method that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussians and learns them in canonical space with a deformation field to model monocular dynamic scenes. We also introduce an annealing smoothing training mechanism with no extra overhead, which can mitigate the impact of inaccurate poses on the smoothness of time interpolation tasks in real-world datasets. Through a differential Gaussian rasterizer, the deformable 3D Gaussians not only achieve higher rendering quality but also real-time rendering speed. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods significantly in terms of both rendering quality and speed, making it well-suited for tasks such as novel-view synthesis, time interpolation, and real-time rendering.",

    "abstract": "Colorization is a well-explored problem in the domains of image and video processing. However, extending colorization to 3D scenes presents significant challenges. Recent Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and Gaussian-Splatting(3DGS) methods enable high-quality novel-view synthesis for multi-view images. However, the question arises: How can we colorize these 3D representations? This work presents a method for synthesizing colorized novel views from input grayscale multi-view images. Using image or video colorization methods to colorize novel views from these 3D representations naively will yield output with severe inconsistencies. We introduce a novel method to use powerful image colorization models for colorizing 3D representations. We propose a distillation-based method that transfers color from these networks trained on natural images to the target 3D representation. Notably, this strategy does not add any additional weights or computational overhead to the original representation during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality colorized views for indoor and outdoor scenes, showcasing significant cross-view consistency advantages over baseline approaches. Our method is agnostic to the underlying 3D representation and easily generalizable to NeRF and 3DGS methods. Further, we validate the efficacy of our approach in several diverse applications: 1.) Infra-Red (IR) multi-view images and 2.) Legacy grayscale multi-view image sequences. Project Webpage: https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/chroma-distill.github.io/",

We follow an analysis-by-synthesis framework, inspired by recent work that models scenes as a collection of 3D Gaussians which are optimized to reconstruct input images via differentiable rendering. To model dynamic scenes, we allow Gaussians to move and rotate over time while enforcing that they have persistent color, opacity, and size. By regularizing Gaussians' motion and rotation with local-rigidity constraints, we show that our Dynamic 3D Gaussians correctly model the same area of physical space over time, including the rotation of that space. Dense 6-DOF tracking and dynamic reconstruction emerges naturally from persistent dynamic view synthesis, without requiring any correspondence or flow as input. We demonstrate a large number of downstream applications enabled by our representation, including first-person view synthesis, dynamic compositional scene synthesis, and 4D video editing.",

    "abstract": "Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allow high-quality real-time (>= 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution. First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets.",

We find that the spatial widths-squared for the production and detection appear additively in the (de)coherence length and in the localization factor for governing the propagation of the wave packet, whereas they appear as the reduced one (inverse of the sum of inverse) in the momentum conservation factor.

Instead of leveraging matching-based solutions from 2D wireframes (or line segments) for 3D wireframe reconstruction as done in prior arts, we present NEAT, a rendering-distilling formulation using neural fields to represent 3D line segments with 2D observations, and bipartite matching for perceiving and distilling of a sparse set of 3D global junctions. The proposed {NEAT} enjoys the joint optimization of the neural fields and the global junctions from scratch, using view-dependent 2D observations without precomputed cross-view feature matching. Comprehensive experiments on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets demonstrate our NEAT's superiority over state-of-the-art alternatives for 3D wireframe reconstruction. Moreover, the distilled 3D global junctions by NEAT, are a better initialization than SfM points, for the recently-emerged 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-fidelity novel view synthesis using about 20 times fewer initial 3D points.

Our key idea is to regularize the reconstruction, which is severely ill-posed and leaving significant gaps between the sparse views, by learning a set of neural templates to act as surface priors. Our method, coined DiViNet, operates in two stages. It first learns the templates, in the form of 3D Gaussian functions, across different scenes, without 3D supervision. In the reconstruction stage, our predicted templates serve as anchors to help \"stitch'' the surfaces over sparse regions. We demonstrate that our approach is not only able to complete the surface geometry but also reconstructs surface details to a reasonable extent from a few disparate input views. On the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets, our approach achieves the best reconstruction quality among existing methods in the presence of such sparse views and performs on par, if not better, with competing methods when dense views are employed as inputs.",

Different from using diffusion priors to regularize representation optimization, our method directly uses diffusion-generated images to train NeRF/3DGS as if they were real input views. Specifically, we propose a deceptive diffusion model turning noisy images rendered from few-view reconstructions into high-quality photorealistic pseudo-observations. To resolve consistency among pseudo-observations and real input views, we develop an uncertainty measure to guide the diffusion model's generation. Our system progressively incorporates diffusion-generated pseudo-observations into the training image sets, ultimately densifying the sparse input observations by 5 to 10 times.

In this work, we show that explicitly integrating 3D compositional object representations into deep networks for image classification leads to a largely enhanced generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios. In particular, we introduce a novel architecture, referred to as NOVUM, that consists of a feature extractor and a neural object volume for every target object class. Each neural object volume is a composition of 3D Gaussians that emit feature vectors. This compositional object representation allows for a highly robust and fast estimation of the object class by independently matching the features of the 3D Gaussians of each category to features extracted from an input image. Additionally, the object pose can be estimated via inverse rendering of the corresponding neural object volume. To enable the classification of objects, the neural features at each 3D Gaussian are trained discriminatively to be distinct from (i) the features of 3D Gaussians in other categories, (ii) features of other 3D Gaussians of the same object, and (iii) the background features. Our experiments show that NOVUM offers intriguing advantages over standard architectures due to the 3D compositional structure of the object representation, namely: (1) An exceptional robustness across a spectrum of real-world and synthetic out-of-distribution shifts and (2) an enhanced human interpretability compared to standard models, all while maintaining real-time inference and a competitive accuracy on in-distribution data.",

Perfusion quantification in ml/100g/min compared to microsphere perfusion uses the 3D gaussian probability distribution and defined water transport time as when 50% of the molecules remain in the tissue of interest. Perfusion, water transport time, and infarct volume was compared to reference standards. Simulations were studied to suppress non-specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Linear regression analysis of quantitative perfusion returned correlation (slope = .55, intercept = 52.5, $R^2$= .64). Linear regression for water transport time asymmetry in infarcted tissue was excellent (slope = .59, intercept = .3, $R^2$ = .93). Strong linear agreement also was found for infarct volume (slope = 1.01, $R^2$= .79). Simulation of CSF suppression via inversion recovery returned blood signal reduced by 82% from combined T1 and T2 effects. Intra-physiologic state comparison of perfusion shows potential partial volume effects which require further study especially in disease states. The accuracy and sensitivity of IVIM provides evidence that observed signal changes reflect cytotoxic edema and tissue perfusion. Partial volume contamination of CSF may be better removed during post-processing rather than with inversion recovery to avoid artificial loss of blood signal.",

There are significant challenges to achieve both stable and bias-free training under arbitrary client availability. To address these challenges, we propose a framework named Federated Graph-based Sampling (FedGS), to stabilize the global model update and mitigate the long-term bias given arbitrary client availability simultaneously. First, we model the data correlations of clients with a Data-Distribution-Dependency Graph (3DG) that helps keep the sampled clients data apart from each other, which is theoretically shown to improve the approximation to the optimal model update. Second, constrained by the far-distance in data distribution of the sampled clients, we further minimize the variance of the numbers of times that the clients are sampled, to mitigate long-term bias. To validate the effectiveness of FedGS, we conduct experiments on three datasets under a comprehensive set of seven client availability modes. Our experimental results confirm FedGS's advantage in both enabling a fair client-sampling scheme and improving the model performance under arbitrary client availability.

This is a challenging problem due to various factors such as poor texture, repetitive patterns, illumination variation, and motion blur in practical scenarios. In contrast to methods that use dense correspondence ground-truths as direct supervision for local feature matching training, we train 3DG-STFM: a multi-modal matching model (Teacher) to enforce the depth consistency under 3D dense correspondence supervision and transfer the knowledge to 2D unimodal matching model (Student). Both teacher and student models consist of two transformer-based matching modules that obtain dense correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner. The teacher model guides the student model to learn RGB-induced depth information for the matching purpose on both coarse and fine branches. We also evaluate 3DG-STFM on a model compression task. To the best of our knowledge, 3DG-STFM is the first student-teacher learning method for the local feature matching task. The experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on indoor and outdoor camera pose estimations, and homography estimation problems.

    "abstract": "Contours are used in radiotherapy treatment planning to identify regions to be irradiated with high dose and regions to be spared. Therefore, any contouring uncertainty influences the whole treatment. Even though this is the biggest remaining source of uncertainty when daily IGRT or adaptation is used, it has not been accounted for quantitatively in treatment planning. Using probabilistic planning allows to directly account for contouring uncertainties in plan optimisation. The first step is to create an algorithm that can generate many realistic contours with variation matching actual inter-observer variation.   We propose a methodology to generate random contours, based on measured spatial inter-observer variation, IOV, and a single parameter that controls its geometrical dependency: alpha, the width of the 3D Gaussian used as point spread function (PSF). We used a level set formulation of the median shape, with the level set function defined as the signed distance transform. To create a new contour, we added the median level set and a noise map which was weighted with the IOV map and then convolved with the PSF. Thresholding the level set function reconstructs the newly generated contour.   We used data from 18 patients from the golden atlas, consisting of five prostate delineations on T2-w MRI scans. To evaluate the similarity between the contours, we calculated the maximum distance to agreement to the median shape (maxDTA), and the minimum dose of the contours using an ideal dose distribution. We used the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the distributions for maxDTA and minDose between the generated and manually delineated contours.   Only alpha=0.75cm produced maxDTA and minDose distributions that were not significantly different from the manually delineated structures. Accounting for the PSF is essential to correctly simulate inter-observer variation.",

This $7016\\,\\mathrm{deg}^{2}$ homogeneous sample comprises the largest set of peculiar velocities produced to date and extends the reach of PV surveys up to a redshift limit of $z=0.1$. Our SDSS-based FP distance measurements have a mean uncertainty of 23%. Alongside the data, we produce an ensemble of 2,048 mock galaxy catalogues that reproduce the data selection function, and are used to validate our fitting pipelines and check for systematic errors. We uncover a significant trend between group richness and mean surface brightness within the sample, which may hint at an environmental dependence within the FP or the presence of unresolved systematics, and can result in biased peculiar velocities. This is removed using multiple FP fits as function of group richness, a procedure made tractable through a new analytic derivation for the integral of a 3D Gaussian over non-trivial limits. Our catalogue is calibrated to the zero-point of the CosmicFlows-III sample with an uncertainty of $0.004$ dex (not including cosmic variance or the error within CosmicFlows-III itself), which is validated using independent cross-checks with the predicted zero-point from the 2M++ reconstruction of our local velocity field. Finally, as an example of what is possible with our new catalogue, we obtain preliminary bulk flow measurements up to a depth of $135\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$. We find a slightly larger-than-expected bulk flow at high redshift, although this could be caused by the presence of the Shapley supercluster which lies outside the SDSS PV footprint.",

We focus on the formalism of persistent homology, the mainstay of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), in the context of excursion set formalism. We also focus on the structure of critical points of stochastic fields, and their relationship with formation and evolution of structures in the universe.   The topological background is accompanied by an investigation of Gaussian field simulations based on the LCDM spectrum, as well as power-law spectra with varying spectral indices. We present the statistical properties in terms of the intensity and difference maps constructed from the persistence diagrams, as well as their distribution functions. We demonstrate that the intensity maps encapsulate information about the distribution of power across the hierarchies of structures in more detailed than the Betti numbers or the Euler characteristic. In particular, the white noise ($n = 0$) case with flat spectrum stands out as the divide between models with positive and negative spectral index. It has the highest proportion of low significance features. This level of information is not available from the geometric Minkowski functionals or the topological Euler characteristic, or even the Betti numbers, and demonstrates the usefulness of hierarchical topological methods. Another important result is the observation that topological characteristics of Gaussian fields depend on the power spectrum, as opposed to the geometric measures that are insensitive to the power spectrum characteristics.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel compute-in-memory (CIM)-based ultra-low-power framework for probabilistic localization of insect-scale drones. The conventional probabilistic localization approaches rely on the three-dimensional (3D) Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based representation of a 3D map. A GMM model with hundreds of mixture functions is typically needed to adequately learn and represent the intricacies of the map. Meanwhile, localization using complex GMM map models is computationally intensive. Since insect-scale drones operate under extremely limited area/power budget, continuous localization using GMM models entails much higher operating energy -- thereby, limiting flying duration and/or size of the drone due to a larger battery. Addressing the computational challenges of localization in an insect-scale drone using a CIM approach, we propose a novel framework of 3D map representation using a harmonic mean of \"Gaussian-like\" mixture (HMGM) model. The likelihood function useful for drone localization can be efficiently implemented by connecting many multi-input inverters in parallel, each programmed with the parameters of the 3D map model represented as HMGM. When the depth measurements are projected to the input of the implementation, the summed current of the inverters emulates the likelihood of the measurement. We have characterized our approach on an RGB-D indoor localization dataset. The average localization error in our approach is $\\sim$0.1125 m which is only slightly degraded than software-based evaluation ($\\sim$0.08 m). Meanwhile, our localization framework is ultra-low-power, consuming as little as $\\sim$17 $\\mu$W power while processing a depth frame in 1.33 ms over hundred pose hypotheses in the particle-filtering (PF) algorithm used to localize the drone.",

In detail, we discuss how to efficiently represent and store a high-dimensional distribution for each cluster. We observe that it suffices to consider low-dimensional marginal distributions for two or three data dimensions at a time to employ common visual analysis techniques. Based on this observation, we represent high-dimensional distributions by combinations of low-dimensional Gaussian mixture models. We discuss the application of common interactive visual analysis techniques to this representation. In particular, we investigate several frequency-based views, such as density plots in 1D and 2D, density-based parallel coordinates, and a time histogram. We visualize the uncertainty introduced by the representation, discuss a level-of-detail mechanism, and explicitly visualize outliers. Furthermore, we propose a spatial visualization by splatting anisotropic 3D Gaussians for which we derive a closed-form solution. Lastly, we describe the application of brushing and linking to this clustered representation. Our evaluation on several large, real-world datasets demonstrates the scaling of our approach.",

    "abstract": "This research provides algorithms and numerical methods to geometrically control the magnitude of the internal and external forces in the reciprocal diagrams of 3D/Polyhedral Graphic statics (3DGS). In 3DGS, the form of the structure and its equilibrium of forces is represented by two polyhedral diagrams that are geometrically and topologically related. The areas of the faces of the force diagram represent the magnitude of the internal and external forces in the system. For the first time, the methods of this research allow the user to control and constrain the areas and edge lengths of the faces of general polyhedrons that can be convex, self-intersecting, or concave. As a result, a designer can explicitly control the force magnitudes in the force diagram and explore the equilibrium of a variety of compression and tension-combined funicular structural forms. In this method, a quadratic formulation is used to compute the area of a single face based on its edge lengths. The approach is applied to manipulating the face geometry with a predefined area and the edge lengths. Subsequently, the geometry of the polyhedron is updated with newly changed faces. This approach is a multi-step algorithm where each step includes computing the geometry of a single face and updating the polyhedral geometry. One of the unique results of this framework is the construction of the zero-area, self-intersecting faces, where the sum of the signed areas of a self-intersecting face is zero, representing a member with zero force in the form diagram. The methodology of this research can clarify the equilibrium of some systems that could not be previously justified using reciprocal polyhedral diagrams. Therefore, it generalizes the principle of the equilibrium of polyhedral frames and opens a completely new horizon in the design of highly-sophisticated funicular polyhedral structures beyond compression-only systems.",

We also demonstrate that the Goos-H\\\"anchen shift becomes an extrinsic property that depends on the beam dimension with an asymptotic behavior limiting its value to that of the propagation length. The proposed theoretical scheme allows predicting some new and unforeseen results such as the effect due to a slight deviation of the angle of incidence or of the beam-waist position with respect to the structure.

It is shown that some excess of realizations of simulated radial distributions actually displays quasi-periodical components with periods about a characteristic scale $2\\pi/k \\sim 100~h^{-1}$~Mpc detected as power-spectrum peaks in vicinity of the first maximum of the modulation function $f_2 (k)$. We revised our previous estimations of the significance of such peaks and found that they were largely overestimated. Thereby quasi-periodical components appearing in some radial distributions of matter are likely to be stochastic (rather than determinative), while the amplitudes of the respective spectral peaks can be quite noticeable. They are partly enhanced by smooth part of the modulating function $f_1(k)$ and, to a far lesser extent, by effects of the BAO (i.e. $f_2(k)$).

    "abstract": "Point cloud is a fundamental 3D representation which is widely used in real world applications such as autonomous driving. As a newly-developed media format which is characterized by complexity and irregularity, point cloud creates a need for compression algorithms which are more flexible than existing codecs. Recently, autoencoders(AEs) have shown their effectiveness in many visual analysis tasks as well as image compression, which inspires us to employ it in point cloud compression. In this paper, we propose a general autoencoder-based architecture for lossy geometry point cloud compression. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first autoencoder-based geometry compression codec that directly takes point clouds as input rather than voxel grids or collections of images. Compared with handcrafted codecs, this approach adapts much more quickly to previously unseen media contents and media formats, meanwhile achieving competitive performance. Our architecture consists of a pointnet-based encoder, a uniform quantizer, an entropy estimation block and a nonlinear synthesis transformation module. In lossy geometry compression of point cloud, results show that the proposed method outperforms the test model for categories 1 and 3 (TMC13) published by MPEG-3DG group on the 125th meeting, and on average a 73.15\\% BD-rate gain is achieved.",

    "abstract": "Cosmic shear - the weak gravitational lensing effect generated by fluctuations of the gravitational tidal fields of the large-scale structure - is one of the most promising tools for current and future cosmological analyses. The spherical-Bessel decomposition of the cosmic shear field (\"3D cosmic shear\") is one way to maximise the amount of redshift information in a lensing analysis and therefore provides a powerful tool to investigate in particular the growth of cosmic structure that is crucial for dark energy studies. However, the computation of simulated 3D cosmic shear covariance matrices presents numerical difficulties, due to the required integrations over highly oscillatory functions. We present and compare two numerical methods and relative implementations to perform these integrations. We then show how to generate 3D Gaussian random fields on the sky in spherical coordinates, starting from the 3D cosmic shear covariances. To validate our field-generation procedure, we calculate the Minkowski functionals associated with our random fields, compare them with the known expectation values for the Gaussian case and demonstrate parameter inference from Minkowski functionals from a cosmic shear survey. This is a first step towards producing fully 3D Minkowski functionals for a lognormal field in 3D to extract Gaussian and non-Gaussian information from the cosmic shear field, as well as towards the use of Minkowski functionals as a probe of cosmology beyond the commonly used two-point statistics.",

    "abstract": "Point cloud compression is a key enabler for the emerging applications of immersive visual communication, autonomous driving and smart cities, etc. In this paper, we propose a hybrid point cloud attribute compression scheme built on an original layered data structure. First, a slice-partition scheme and geometry-adaptive k dimensional-tree (kd-tree) method are devised to generate the four-layer structure. Second, we introduce an efficient block-based intra prediction scheme containing a DC prediction mode and several angular modes, in order to exploit the spatial correlation between adjacent points. Third, an adaptive transform scheme based on Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) is Lagrangian optimized to achieve better transform efficiency. The Lagrange multiplier is off-line derived based on the statistics of color attribute coding. Last but not least, multiple reordering scan modes are dedicated to improve coding efficiency for entropy coding. In intra-frame compression of point cloud color attributes, results demonstrate that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art region-adaptive hierarchical transform (RAHT) system, and on average a 29.37$\\%$ BD-rate gain is achieved. Comparing with the test model for category 1 (TMC1) anchor's coding results, which were recently published by MPEG-3DG group on 121st meeting, a 16.37$\\%$ BD-rate gain is obtained.",

Contrary to previous claims that a direct transition from a WSM to a diffusive metal (DM) occurs, an intermediate phase of Chern insulator (CI) between the two distinct metallic phases should exist due to internode scattering that is comparable to intranode scattering. The critical exponent of localization length is $\\nu\\simeq 1.3$ for both the WSM-CI and CI-DM transitions, in the same universality class of 3D Gaussian unitary ensemble of the Anderson localization transition. The CI phase is confirmed by quantized nonzero Hall conductances in the bulk insulating phase established by localization length calculations. The disorder-induced various plateau-plateau transitions in both the WSM and CI phases are observed and explained by the self-consistent Born approximation. Furthermore, we clarify that the occurrence of zero density of states at Weyl nodes is not a good criterion for the disordered WSM, and there is no fundamental principle to support the hypothesis of divergence of localization length at the WSM-DM transition.",

    "abstract": "A common practice to account for psychophysical biases in vision is to frame them as consequences of a dynamic process relying on optimal inference with respect to a generative model. The present study details the complete formulation of such a generative model intended to probe visual motion perception with a dynamic texture model. It is first derived in a set of axiomatic steps constrained by biological plausibility. We extend previous contributions by detailing three equivalent formulations of this texture model. First, the composite dynamic textures are constructed by the random aggregation of warped patterns, which can be viewed as 3D Gaussian fields. Secondly, these textures are cast as solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation (sPDE). This essential step enables real time, on-the-fly texture synthesis using time-discretized auto-regressive processes. It also allows for the derivation of a local motion-energy model, which corresponds to the log-likelihood of the probability density. The log-likelihoods are essential for the construction of a Bayesian inference framework. We use the dynamic texture model to psychophysically probe speed perception in humans using zoom-like changes in the spatial frequency content of the stimulus. The human data replicates previous findings showing perceived speed to be positively biased by spatial frequency increments. A Bayesian observer who combines a Gaussian likelihood centered at the true speed and a spatial frequency dependent width with a \"slow speed prior\" successfully accounts for the perceptual bias. More precisely, the bias arises from a decrease in the observer's likelihood width estimated from the experiments as the spatial frequency increases. Such a trend is compatible with the trend of the dynamic texture likelihood width.",

Particularly for surface shape refinement we propose a new combination of 3D Gaussians designed to align the projected model with likely silhouette contours without explicit segmentation or edge detection. We obtain reconstructions of much higher quality in outdoor settings than existing methods, and show that we are on par with state-of-the-art methods on indoor scenes for which they were designed",

    "abstract": "The linear stability of three-dimensional (3D) vortices in rotating, stratified flows has been studied by analyzing the non-hydrostatic inviscid Boussinesq equations. We have focused on a widely-used model of geophysical and astrophysical vortices, which assumes an axisymmetric Gaussian structure for pressure anomalies in the horizontal and vertical directions. For a range of Rossby number ($-0.5 < Ro < 0.5$) and Burger number ($0.02 < Bu < 2.3$) relevant to observed long-lived vortices, the growth rate and spatial structure of the most unstable eigenmodes have been numerically calculated and presented as a function of $Ro-Bu$. We have found neutrally-stable vortices only over a small region of the $Ro-Bu$ parameter space: cyclones with $Ro \\sim 0.02-0.05$ and $Bu \\sim 0.85-0.95$. However, we have also found that anticyclones in general have slower growth rates compared to cyclones. In particular, the growth rate of the most unstable eigenmode for anticyclones in a large region of the parameter space (e.g., $Ro<0$ and $0.5 \\lesssim Bu \\lesssim 1.3$) is slower than $50$ turn-around times of the vortex (which often corresponds to several years for ocean eddies). For cyclones, the region with such slow growth rates is confined to $0<Ro<0.1$ and $0.5 \\lesssim Bu \\lesssim 1.3$. While most calculations have been done for $f/\\bar{N}=0.1$ (where $f$ and $\\bar{N}$ are the Coriolis and background Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequencies), we have numerically verified and explained analytically, using non-dimensionalized equations, the insensitivity of the results to reducing $f/\\bar{N}$ to the more ocean-relevant value of $0.01$. The results of this paper provide a steppingstone to study the more complicated problems of the stability of geophysical (e.g., those in the atmospheres of giant planets) and astrophysical vortices (in accretion disks).",

Our method builds up on coarse 4D surface reconstructions, as obtained with commonly used template-based methods. As they only capture models of coarse-to-medium scale detail, fine scale deformation detail is often done in a second pass by using stereo constraints, features, or shading-based refinement. In this paper, we propose a new effective and stable solution to this second step. Our framework creates an implicit representation of the deformable mesh using a dense collection of 3D Gaussian functions on the surface, and a set of 2D Gaussians for the images. The fine scale deformation of all mesh vertices that maximizes photo-consistency can be efficiently found by densely optimizing a new model-to-image consistency energy on all vertex positions. A principal advantage is that our problem formulation yields a smooth closed form energy with implicit occlusion handling and analytic derivatives. Error-prone correspondence finding, or discrete sampling of surface displacement values are also not needed. We show several reconstructions of human subjects wearing loose clothing, and we qualitatively and quantitatively show that we robustly capture more detail than related methods.",

This inhibits previous segmentation methods from achieving high accuracies, especially compared to other organs such as the liver, heart or kidneys. In this paper, we present a probabilistic bottom-up approach for pancreas segmentation in abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans, using multi-level deep convolutional networks (ConvNets). We propose and evaluate several variations of deep ConvNets in the context of hierarchical, coarse-to-fine classification on image patches and regions, i.e. superpixels. We first present a dense labeling of local image patches via $P{-}\\mathrm{ConvNet}$ and nearest neighbor fusion. Then we describe a regional ConvNet ($R_1{-}\\mathrm{ConvNet}$) that samples a set of bounding boxes around each image superpixel at different scales of contexts in a \"zoom-out\" fashion. Our ConvNets learn to assign class probabilities for each superpixel region of being pancreas. Last, we study a stacked $R_2{-}\\mathrm{ConvNet}$ leveraging the joint space of CT intensities and the $P{-}\\mathrm{ConvNet}$ dense probability maps. Both 3D Gaussian smoothing and 2D conditional random fields are exploited as structured predictions for post-processing. We evaluate on CT images of 82 patients in 4-fold cross-validation.

    "abstract": "Theoretical arguments suggest that dust grains should grow in the dense cold parts of molecular clouds. Evidence of larger grains has so far been gathered in near/mid infrared extinction and millimeter observations. Interpreting the data is, however, aggravated by the complex interplay of density and dust properties (as well as temperature for thermal emission). We present new Spitzer data of L183 in bands that are sensitive and insensitive to PAHs. The visual extinction AV map derived in a former paper was fitted by a series of 3D Gaussian distributions. For different dust models, we calculate the scattered MIR radiation images of structures that agree agree with the AV map and compare them to the Spitzer data. The Spitzer data of L183 show emission in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands, while the 5.8 micron band shows slight absorption. The emission layer of stochastically heated particles should coincide with the layer of strongest scattering of optical interstellar radiation, which is seen as an outer surface on I band images different from the emission region seen in the Spitzer images. Moreover, PAH emission is expected to strongly increase from 4.5 to 5.8 micron, which is not seen. Hence, we interpret this emission to be MIR cloudshine. Scattered light modeling when assuming interstellar medium dust grains without growth does not reproduce flux measurable by Spitzer. In contrast, models with grains growing with density yield images with a flux and pattern comparable to the Spitzer images in the bands 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 micron.",

    "abstract": "We present Hanbury-Brown Twiss measurements from the PHENIX experiment at RHIC for final results for charged kaon pairs from sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions and preliminary results for charged pion pairs from sqrt{s} = 200 GeV p+p collisions. We find that for kaon pairs from Au+Au, each traditional 3D Gaussian radius shows approximately the same linear increase as a function of N^{1/3}_{part}. An imaging analysis reveals a significant non-Gaussian tail for r \\gtrsim 10 fm. The presence of a tail for kaon pairs demonstrates that similar non-Gaussian tails observed in earlier pion measurements cannot be fully explained by decays of long-lived resonances. The preliminary analysis of pions from sqrt{s} = 200 GeV p+p minimum biased collisions show correlations which are well suited to traditional 3D HBT radii extraction via the Bowler-Sinyukov method, and we present R_out, R_side, and R_long as a function of mean transverse pair mass.",

In the context of cosmological matter distribution the subset of critical lines of the 3D density field serves to delineate the skeleton of the observed filamentary structure at large scales. A stiff approximation used to quantitatively describe the filamentary skeleton shows that the flux of the skeleton lines is related to the average Gaussian curvature of the 1D (2D) sections of the field, much in the same way as the density of the peaks. The distribution of the length of the critical lines with threshold is analyzed in detail, while the extended descriptors of the skeleton - its curvature and its singular points, are introduced and briefly described. Theoretical predictions are compared to measurements of the skeleton in realizations of Gaussian random fields in 2D and 3D. It is found that the stiff approximation predicts accurately the shape of the differential length, allows for analytical insight, and explicit closed form solutions. Finally, it provides a simple classification of the singular points of the critical lines: i) critical points; ii) bifurcation points; iii) slopping plateaux.",

Within the numerical accuracy of the thus obtained fits we find for $N_{\\tau}=4$, 5 and~6 second order critical exponents, which exhibit no obvious $N_{\\tau}$ dependence. The exponents are consistent with 3d Gaussian values, but not with either first order transitions or the universality class of the 3d XY model.

An analysis of the statistical properties of such pinning fields is presented within the context of the Gaussian Random Field Ising Model (RFIM). We show that the average of the pinning fields exhibits a drastic increase close to the coercive field and that such an increase is discontinuous for low degrees of disorder. This behaviour can be described with standard finite size scaling (FSS) assumptions. Furthermore, we also show that the pinning fields corresponding to states close to coercivity exhibit strong statistical correlations.",

Two ISOCAM images at 7 and 15 micron are fitted simultaneously by representing the dust distribution in the core with a series of 3D Gaussian density profiles. Size, total density, and position of the Gaussians are optimized by simulated annealing to obtain a 2D column density map. The projected core density has a complex elongated pattern with two peaks. We propose a new method to calculate an approximate temperature in an externally illuminated complex 3D structure from a mean optical depth. This T(tau)-method is applied to a 1.3 mm map obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope to find the approximate 3D density and temperature distribution of the core Rho Oph D. The spatial 3D distribution deviates strongly from spherical symmetry. The elongated structure is in general agreement with recent gravo-turbulent collapse calculations for molecular clouds. We discuss possible ambiguities of the background determination procedure, errors of the maps, the accuracy of the T(tau)-method, and the influence of the assumed dust particle sizes and properties.",

They are classified as being non-spanning, 1d-spanning, 2d-spanning or 3d-spanning depending on whether or not they span the whole lattice in the different space directions. Moreover, finite-size scaling analysis enables identification of two different types of non-spanning avalanches (critical and supercritical) and two different types of 3d-spanning avalanches (critical and subcritical), whose numbers increase with L as a power-law with different exponents. We conclude by giving a scenario for the avalanches behaviour in the thermodynamic limit.",

    "abstract": "The nature of the zero temperature ordering transition in the 3D Gaussian random field Ising magnet is studied numerically, aided by scaling analyses. In the ferromagnetic phase the scaling of the roughness of the domain walls, $w\\sim L^\\zeta$, is consistent with the theoretical prediction $\\zeta = 2/3$. As the randomness is increased through the transition, the probability distribution of the interfacial tension of domain walls scales as for a single second order transition. At the critical point, the fractal dimensions of domain walls and the fractal dimension of the outer surface of spin clusters are investigated: there are at least two distinct physically important fractal dimensions. These dimensions are argued to be related to combinations of the energy scaling exponent, $\\theta$, which determines the violation of hyperscaling, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$, and the magnetization exponent $\\beta$. The value $\\beta = 0.017\\pm 0.005$ is derived from the magnetization: this estimate is supported by the study of the spin cluster size distribution at criticality. The variation of configurations in the interior of a sample with boundary conditions is consistent with the hypothesis that there is a single transition separating the disordered phase with one ground state from the ordered phase with two ground states. The array of results are shown to be consistent with a scaling picture and a geometric description of the influence of boundary conditions on the spins. The details of the algorithm used and its implementation are also described.",

Instead of the Green function we compute its temporal integral, that gives the static potential energy of the interaction of the two sources.
