    "abstract": "We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive perspective of 4D representations\\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation, application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction. Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available, as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project page:https://mingrui-zhao.github.io/4DRep-GMI/",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router. Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts, enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency.

    "abstract": "Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a significant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to predict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of acquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D information while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that by synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we can regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve this, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of real hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data. Unlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines grasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping datasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9% over existing image-based methods.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle, which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner. Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.",

While recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon, where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification criterion incorporating $\\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally, our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.",

Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing baselines by a large margin.

Existing benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware 3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.",

    "abstract": "Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\\emph{i.e.}, the point cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints (regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i) frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points, compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii) point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a stronger initialization strategy.

Representing these planes in a structured and parameterized format facilitates scene editing and physical simulations in downstream applications. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in the Novel View Synthesis task, with extensions showing great potential in accurate surface reconstruction. However, even state-of-the-art GS representations often struggle to reconstruct planar regions with sufficient smoothness and precision. To address this issue, we propose GSPlane, which recovers accurate geometry and produces clean and well-structured mesh connectivity for plane regions in the reconstructed scene. By leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and normal prediction models, GSPlane extracts robust planar priors to establish structured representations for planar Gaussian coordinates, which help guide the training process by enforcing geometric consistency. To further enhance training robustness, a Dynamic Gaussian Re-classifier is introduced to adaptively reclassify planar Gaussians with persistently high gradients as non-planar, ensuring more reliable optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the optimized planar priors to refine the mesh layouts, significantly improving topological structure while reducing the number of vertices and faces. We also explore applications of the structured planar representation, which enable decoupling and flexible manipulation of objects on supportive planes.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly influenced neural fields, as it enables high-fidelity rendering with impressive visual quality. However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In contrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian disks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains compromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality rendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both geometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that uses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while maintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians with the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place cloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R model with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the original 2DGS, our method requires only 1\\% more storage and minimal additional training time. Despite this negligible overhead, it achieves high-quality rendering results while preserving fine geometric structures. These findings indicate that our approach effectively balances efficiency with performance, leading to improvements in both visual fidelity and geometric reconstruction accuracy.",

However, in digital human encoding and transmission, the compression methods based on general 3DGS representations are limited by the lack of human priors, resulting in suboptimal bitrate efficiency and reconstruction quality at the decoder side, which hinders their application in streamable 3D avatar systems. We propose HGC-Avatar, a novel Hierarchical Gaussian Compression framework designed for efficient transmission and high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. Our method disentangles the Gaussian representation into a structural layer, which maps poses to Gaussians via a StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer, which leverages the SMPL-X model to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. This hierarchical design supports layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs such as video sequences or text. Since people are most concerned with facial realism, we incorporate a facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and expression details under low-bitrate constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that HGC-Avatar provides a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar rendering, while significantly outperforming prior methods in both visual quality and compression efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization, aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal, replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and versatility.

However, most existing methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures. Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy. PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.",

However, existing methods often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction. To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90% redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization, our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation, demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction.

To address this, we introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful representational capacity of learned image priors to recover compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.",

To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in shared memory.

In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges 2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction.

We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.

Existing methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This \"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat\" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured photos.",

Many approaches have been proposed to animate Gaussian Splatting, but they often require camera arrays, long preprocessing times, or high-end GPUs. Some methods attempt to convert Gaussian Splatting into mesh-based representations, achieving lightweight performance but sacrificing visual fidelity. In contrast, our system efficiently animates Gaussian Splatting by leveraging parallel splat-wise processing to dynamically follow the underlying skinned mesh in real time while preserving high visual fidelity. From smartphone-based 3D scanning to on-device preprocessing, the entire process takes just around five minutes, with the avatar generation step itself completed in only about 30 seconds. Our system enables users to instantly transform their real-world appearance into a 3D avatar, making it ideal for seamless integration with social media and metaverse applications.

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as \"generator\" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D reconstruction system as \"decoder\". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories, without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene composition.",

    "abstract": "Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short) strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization (PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm. Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication costs.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation, vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene reconstruction. However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives densification caused by motion blur. To solve these problems, we introduce a novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D scenes from motion-blurred images. BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions. Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further corrects motion-induced blur distortions. To alleviate multi-subframe gradient conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both stages. Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority over the state of the arts.Our source code is available at https://github.com/wsxujm/bsgs",

Our solution is inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS.

To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects, while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to over 350 FPS.",

This versatile architecture delivers a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study involving 18 participants.

In the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only. This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS, i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images) from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied in our setting.

To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL pipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter estimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our approach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric reconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions over physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from interaction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical parameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based uncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying center of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution, Phys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization baseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23% in the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion for hammer pushing.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment. In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

    "abstract": "Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering (PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling, resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end, we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with 2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in novel views synthesis.",

Due to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction. In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating unseen view information to constrain scene optimization.

While simulated data offers a scalable alternative, it often fails to generalize to the real world due to significant gaps in visual appearance, physical properties, and object interactions. To address this, we propose RoboSimGS, a novel Real2Sim2Real framework that converts multi-view real-world images into scalable, high-fidelity, and physically interactive simulation environments for robotic manipulation. Our approach reconstructs scenes using a hybrid representation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) captures the photorealistic appearance of the environment, while mesh primitives for interactive objects ensure accurate physics simulation. Crucially, we pioneer the use of a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to automate the creation of physically plausible, articulated assets. The MLLM analyzes visual data to infer not only physical properties (e.g., density, stiffness) but also complex kinematic structures (e.g., hinges, sliding rails) of objects. We demonstrate that policies trained entirely on data generated by RoboSimGS achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across a diverse set of real-world manipulation tasks. Furthermore, data from RoboSimGS significantly enhances the performance and generalization capabilities of SOTA methods. Our results validate RoboSimGS as a powerful and scalable solution for bridging the sim-to-real gap.",

The framework begins by training a canonical Gaussian avatar using articulated splatting in a network-free manner, which serves as the foundation for avatar appearance modeling. Simultaneously, a human-prior template is employed to capture temporal body movements through compact parametric representations. This decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution minimizes redundancy, enabling efficient compression: the canonical avatar is shared across the sequence, requiring compression only once, while the temporal parameters, consisting of just 94 parameters per frame, are transmitted with minimal bit-rate. For each frame, the target human avatar is generated by deforming canonical avatar via Linear Blend Skinning transformation, facilitating temporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional 2D/3D codecs and existing learnable dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting compression method in terms of rate-distortion performance on mainstream multi-view human video datasets, paving the way for seamless immersive multimedia experiences in meta-verse applications.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view synthesis.",

In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view, enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich renderings with precise user control.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.",

However, despite achieving promising results, most existing algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this, we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low storage footprint (around \\textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to \\textbf{40$\\times$} and \\textbf{90$\\times$} compression on synthetic and real-world scenes, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels (DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and causes jarring visual ``popping\" artifacts during transitions, degrading the user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm: Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity. This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of performance targets.",

We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations, significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines while enabling fast and light-weight updates.",

The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2) steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs, parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones; contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues and years.",

    "abstract": "Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics, requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however, extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING (FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications - including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing - show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster convergence.

We introduce a two-stage Gaussian Splatting framework that explicitly separates and optimizes these regions, yielding higher-fidelity novel view synthesis. In stage one, background primitives are initialized within a spherical shell and optimized using a loss that combines a background-only photometric term with two geometric regularizers: one constraining Gaussians to remain inside the shell, and another aligning them with local tangential planes. In stage two, foreground Gaussians are initialized from a Structure-from-Motion reconstruction, added and refined using the standard rendering loss, while the background set remains fixed but contributes to the final image formation. Experiments on diverse outdoor datasets show that our method reduces background artifacts and improves perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the explicit background separation enables automatic, object-free environment map estimation, opening new possibilities for photorealistic outdoor rendering and mixed-reality applications.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically, achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for both static and dynamic objects.

We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that operates in a $16 \\times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \\times$ fewer Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \\times 256$ to $540 \\times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed.

To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS, comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through targeted supervision.

Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power. Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\\times$ fewer primitives and $6\\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or adaptation frameworks. The project page is https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/SplatNet/.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing ``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around 1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and robustness under demanding 4K rendering.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively, the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS with the help of event data.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360 degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for editing.

We present an end-to-end pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) to enable rapid acquisition and interactive rendering of real-world objects using a mobile device, cloud processing and a local computer. Users scan an object with a smartphone video, upload it for automated 3D reconstruction, and visualize it interactively in Unity at an average of 150 frames per second (fps) on a laptop. The system integrates mobile capture, cloud-based 3D GS and Unity rendering to support real-time telepresence.

Addressing this, we identify notable redundancies across the SLAM pipeline for acceleration. While conceptually straightforward, practical approaches are required to minimize the overhead associated with identifying and eliminating these redundancies. In response, we propose RTGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that comprehensively reduces the redundancies for real-time 3DGS-SLAM on edge. To minimize the overhead, RTGS fully leverages the characteristics of the 3DGS-SLAM pipeline. On the algorithm side, we introduce (1) an adaptive Gaussian pruning step to remove the redundant Gaussians by reusing gradients computed during backpropagation; and (2) a dynamic downsampling technique that directly reuses the keyframe identification and alpha computing steps to eliminate redundant pixels. On the hardware side, we propose (1) a subtile-level streaming strategy and a pixel-level pairwise scheduling strategy that mitigates workload imbalance via a Workload Scheduling Unit (WSU) guided by previous iteration information; (2) a Rendering and Backpropagation (R&B) Buffer that accelerates the rendering backpropagation by reusing intermediate data computed during rendering; and (3) a Gradient Merging Unit (GMU) to reduce intensive memory accesses caused by atomic operations while enabling pipelined aggregation. Integrated into an edge GPU, RTGS achieves real-time performance (>= 30 FPS) on four datasets and three algorithms, with up to 82.5x energy efficiency over the baseline and negligible quality loss.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual quality. In this work, we propose \"ArchitectHead\", the first framework for creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering. ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining. Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method uses only 6.2\\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss +7.9\\%, PSNR --0.97\\%, SSIM --0.6\\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\\%), and the rendering speed nearly doubles.",

    "abstract": "4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions. However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations, further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while maintaining reconstruction quality. These results position OMG4 as a significant step forward in compact 4D scene representation, opening new possibilities for a wide range of applications.

    "abstract": "We propose SketchPlan, a diffusion-based planner that interprets 2D hand-drawn sketches over depth images to generate 3D flight paths for drone navigation. SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label 872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests, SketchPlan achieved 100\\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\\% in unseen high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\\% in task completion.",

    "abstract": "Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and performance of pretrained semantic features.",

    "abstract": "Visual policy design is crucial for aerial navigation. However, state-of-the-art visual policies often overfit to a single track and their performance degrades when track geometry changes. We develop FalconGym 2.0, a photorealistic simulation framework built on Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) with an Edit API that programmatically generates diverse static and dynamic tracks in milliseconds. Leveraging FalconGym 2.0's editability, we propose a Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm, which concentrates visual policy's training on challenging tracks while iteratively improving its performance. Across two case studies (fixed-wing UAVs and quadrotors) with distinct dynamics and environments, we show that a single visual policy trained with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generalization and robustness: it generalizes to three unseen tracks with 100% success without per-track retraining and maintains higher success rates under gate-pose perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that the visual policy trained with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 can be zero-shot sim-to-real transferred to a quadrotor hardware, achieving a 98.6% success rate (69 / 70 gates) over 30 trials spanning two three-gate tracks and a moving-gate track.",

    "abstract": "Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to existing Gaussian splatting methods.",

    "abstract": "We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling. The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors 3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior 2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by 26.2%.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose 4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism, which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions. Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective 4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works, our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our code will be made available upon acceptance.",

Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i) partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves up to $2\\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.",

    "abstract": "While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1) dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation generalizability.

Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by 18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on a wide range of datasets.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a transformative technique with profound implications on novel view synthesis and real-time rendering. Given its importance, there have been many attempts to improve its performance. However, with the increasing complexity of GPU architectures and the vast search space of performance-tuning parameters, it is a challenging task. Although manual optimizations have achieved remarkable speedups, they require domain expertise and the optimization process can be highly time consuming and error prone. In this paper, we propose to exploit large language models (LLMs) to analyze and optimize Gaussian splatting kernels. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use LLMs to optimize highly specialized real-world GPU kernels. We reveal the intricacies of using LLMs for code optimization and analyze the code optimization techniques from the LLMs. We also propose ways to collaborate with LLMs to further leverage their capabilities. For the original 3DGS code on the MipNeRF360 datasets, LLMs achieve significant speedups, 19% with Deepseek and 24% with GPT-5, demonstrating the different capabilities of different LLMs. By feeding additional information from performance profilers, the performance improvement from LLM-optimized code is enhanced to up to 42% and 38% on average. In comparison, our best-effort manually optimized version can achieve a performance improvement up to 48% and 39% on average, showing that there are still optimizations beyond the capabilities of current LLMs. On the other hand, even upon a newly proposed 3DGS framework with algorithmic optimizations, Seele, LLMs can still further enhance its performance by 6%, showing that there are optimization opportunities missed by domain experts. This highlights the potential of collaboration between domain experts and LLMs.",

    "abstract": "We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions, preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large resolution increases.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians, enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines, which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training. Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs.

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to 48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction, unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy.

    "abstract": "Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward pass.

    "abstract": "Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views presents a formidable challenge in 3D reconstruction, where limited multi-view constraints lead to severe overfitting, geometric distortion, and fragmented scenes. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers real-time, high-fidelity rendering, its performance drastically deteriorates under sparse inputs, plagued by floating artifacts and structural failures. To address these challenges, we introduce HBSplat, a unified framework that elevates 3DGS by seamlessly integrating robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region completion. Our core contributions are threefold: a Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that ensures multi-view consistency by leveraging dense matching priors and integrating reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method that enforces substantially stronger constraints by creating high-fidelity virtual views through bidirectional depth-image warping and multi-view fusion; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that recovers occluded areas using a depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model. Extensive evaluations on LLFF, Blender, and DTU benchmarks validate that HBSplat sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS, while maintaining real-time inference.

    "abstract": "Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering quality. We introduce ExGS, a novel feed-forward framework that unifies Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) with GaussPainter for Extreme 3DGS compression. UGC performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas GaussPainter leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can even achieve over 100X compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and high-quality neural rendering.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering. To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail (LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles: first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training, avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset, Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis, and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However, existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh. OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\\% over the 2DGS baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage. Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches impractical or impossible.

This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals: photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency.

OriGS addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time, space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global motion intent.

We propose OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our \"propose-and-validate\" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the 3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss. Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.",

    "abstract": "Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii) patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about 97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission efficient for edge cloud learning.",

    "abstract": "We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods, delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.",

    "abstract": "Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously addressing their monosemous limitations.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby enabling practical downstream rendering applications.",

First, we enhance text-to-3D background generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning, ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.",

Current methods primarily focus on static scenes, implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living. However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge, we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will be released.",

This paper introduces PowerGS, the first framework to jointly minimize the rendering and display power in 3DGS under a quality constraint. We present a general problem formulation and show that solving the problem amounts to 1) identifying the iso-quality curve(s) in the landscape subtended by the display and rendering power and 2) identifying the power-minimal point on a given curve, which has a closed-form solution given a proper parameterization of the curves. PowerGS also readily supports foveated rendering for further power savings. Extensive experiments and user studies show that PowerGS achieves up to 86% total power reduction compared to state-of-the-art 3DGS models, with minimal loss in both subjective and objective quality.

    "abstract": "In-line holography offers high space-bandwidth product imaging with a simplified lens-free optical system. However, in-line holographic reconstruction is troubled by twin images arising from the Hermitian symmetry of complex fields. Twin images disrupt the reconstruction in solving the ill-posed phase retrieval problem. The known parameters are less than the unknown parameters, causing phase ambiguities. State-of-the-art deep-learning or non-learning methods face challenges in balancing data fidelity with twin-image disturbance. We propose the Gaussian splatting holography (GSH) for twin-image-suppressed holographic reconstruction. GSH uses Gaussian splatting for optical field representation and compresses the number of unknown parameters by a maximum of 15 folds, transforming the original ill-posed phase retrieval into a well-posed one with reduced phase ambiguities. Additionally, the Gaussian splatting tends to form sharp patterns rather than those with noisy twin-image backgrounds as each Gaussian has a spatially slow-varying profile. Experiments show that GSH achieves constraint-free recovery for in-line holography with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art constraint-based methods, with an average peak signal-to-noise ratio equal to 26 dB, and structure similarity equal to 0.8. Combined with total variation, GSH can be further improved, obtaining a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 31 dB, and a high compression ability of up to 15 folds.",

Bridging generation and novel view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising. This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance in downstream evaluations.

    "abstract": "This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene completion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting methods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based diffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing regions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing directly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring spatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for time-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly repetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities within the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for structural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting. Practically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch measurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and, subsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in 3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective substitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and the results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability. Additional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of the proposed 3D inpainting strategy.

The primary contribution of this study is a feature matching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate intermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive viewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are reconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to their large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for scene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For accurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed by using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate high-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and ground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature matching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground images, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences through intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the validation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature matching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can provide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious increase in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide enough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based scene rendering.",

We present BiTAA, a bi-task adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation (EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents SeHDR, a novel high dynamic range 3D Gaussian Splatting (HDR-3DGS) approach for generating HDR novel views given multi-view LDR images. Unlike existing methods that typically require the multi-view LDR input images to be captured from different exposures, which are tedious to capture and more likely to suffer from errors (e.g., object motion blurs and calibration/alignment inaccuracies), our approach learns the HDR scene representation from multi-view LDR images of a single exposure. Our key insight to this ill-posed problem is that by first estimating Bracketed 3D Gaussians (i.e., with different exposures) from single-exposure multi-view LDR images, we may then be able to merge these bracketed 3D Gaussians into an HDR scene representation. Specifically, SeHDR first learns base 3D Gaussians from single-exposure LDR inputs, where the spherical harmonics parameterize colors in a linear color space. We then estimate multiple 3D Gaussians with identical geometry but varying linear colors conditioned on exposure manipulations. Finally, we propose the Differentiable Neural Exposure Fusion (NeEF) to integrate the base and estimated 3D Gaussians into HDR Gaussians for novel view rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeHDR outperforms existing methods as well as carefully designed baselines.",

    "abstract": "Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a 3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in wider communities.

Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.",

We present WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain: diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient, leave-one-out strategy.

Existing solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments.",

Without calculating camera poses as an intermediate result, we avoid the cumulative errors transfer from inaccurate camera poses to the initial point clouds' positions. Second, we introduce the event stream into the deblur pipeline for its high sensitivity to dynamic change. By decoding the latent sharp images from the event stream and blurred images, we can provide a fine-grained supervision signal for scene reconstruction optimization. Extensive experiments across a range of scenes demonstrate that DeblurSplat not only excels in generating high-fidelity novel views but also achieves significant rendering efficiency compared to the SOTAs in deblur 3D-GS.",

However, reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse viewpoints remains highly challenging due to insufficient visual information, which results in noticeable artifacts persisting across the 3D representation. To address this limitation, recent methods have resorted to generative priors to remove artifacts and complete missing content in under-constrained areas. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches struggle to ensure multi-view consistency, resulting in blurred structures and implausible details. In this work, we propose FixingGS, a training-free method that fully exploits the capabilities of the existing diffusion model for sparse-view 3DGS reconstruction enhancement. At the core of FixingGS is our distillation approach, which delivers more accurate and cross-view coherent diffusion priors, thereby enabling effective artifact removal and inpainting. In addition, we propose an adaptive progressive enhancement scheme that further refines reconstructions in under-constrained regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixingGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods with superior visual quality and reconstruction performance. Our code will be released publicly.",

In this work, we present SINGER for language-guided autonomous drone navigation in the open world using only onboard sensing and compute. To train robust, open-vocabulary navigation policies, SINGER leverages three central components: (i) a photorealistic language-embedded flight simulator with minimal sim-to-real gap using Gaussian Splatting for efficient data generation, (ii) an RRT-inspired multi-trajectory generation expert for collision-free navigation demonstrations, and these are used to train (iii) a lightweight end-to-end visuomotor policy for real-time closed-loop control. Through extensive hardware flight experiments, we demonstrate superior zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of our policy to unseen environments and unseen language-conditioned goal objects. When trained on ~700k-1M observation action pairs of language conditioned visuomotor data and deployed on hardware, SINGER outperforms a velocity-controlled semantic guidance baseline by reaching the query 23.33% more on average, and maintains the query in the field of view 16.67% more on average, with 10% fewer collisions.",

However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective properties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric ambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address these limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been prohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner loop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that make the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less accurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build an efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the classic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space of spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend the classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives, propose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the backward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than auto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering where light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent reflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry reconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering baselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known or unknown lighting conditions.",

As strengths, sparse voxels support preserving the coverage completeness and geometric clarity, while corresponding challenges also arise from absent scene constraints and locality in surface refinement. To ensure correct scene convergence, we first propose a Voxel-Uncertainty Depth Constraint that maximizes the effect of monocular depth cues while presenting a voxel-oriented uncertainty to avoid quality degradation, enabling effective and robust scene constraints yet preserving highly accurate geometries. Subsequently, Sparse Voxel Surface Regularization is designed to enhance geometric consistency for tiny voxels and facilitate the voxel-based formation of sharp and accurate surfaces.

    "abstract": "Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is essential for solving complex real-world problems involving multiple conflicting objectives. However, many practical applications - including engineering design, autonomous systems, and machine learning - often yield non-convex, degenerate, or discontinuous Pareto frontiers, which involve traditional scalarization and Pareto Set Learning (PSL) methods that struggle to approximate accurately. Existing PSL approaches perform well on convex fronts but tend to fail in capturing the diversity and structure of irregular Pareto sets commonly observed in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Gaussian-PSL, a novel framework that integrates Gaussian Splatting into PSL to address the challenges posed by non-convex Pareto frontiers. Our method dynamically partitions the preference vector space, enabling simple MLP networks to learn localized features within each region, which are then integrated by an additional MLP aggregator. This partition-aware strategy enhances both exploration and convergence, reduces sensi- tivity to initialization, and improves robustness against local optima. We first provide the mathematical formulation for controllable Pareto set learning using Gaussian Splat- ting. Then, we introduce the Gaussian-PSL architecture and evaluate its performance on synthetic and real-world multi-objective benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms standard PSL models in learning irregular Pareto fronts while maintaining computational efficiency and model simplicity.

    "abstract": "The field of Embodied AI predominantly relies on simulation for training and evaluation, often using either fully synthetic environments that lack photorealism or high-fidelity real-world reconstructions captured with expensive hardware. As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate improvements of 20% and 40% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover, our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87-0.97) for the reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to diverse environments with minimal effort.

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful alternative to NeRF-based approaches, enabling real-time, high-quality novel view synthesis through explicit, optimizable 3D Gaussians. However, 3DGS suffers from significant memory overhead due to its reliance on per-Gaussian parameters to model view-dependent effects and anisotropic shapes. While recent works propose compressing 3DGS with neural fields, these methods struggle to capture high-frequency spatial variations in Gaussian properties, leading to degraded reconstruction of fine details. We present Hybrid Radiance Fields (HyRF), a novel scene representation that combines the strengths of explicit Gaussians and neural fields. HyRF decomposes the scene into (1) a compact set of explicit Gaussians storing only critical high-frequency parameters and (2) grid-based neural fields that predict remaining properties. To enhance representational capacity, we introduce a decoupled neural field architecture, separately modeling geometry (scale, opacity, rotation) and view-dependent color. Additionally, we propose a hybrid rendering scheme that composites Gaussian splatting with a neural field-predicted background, addressing limitations in distant scene representation. Experiments demonstrate that HyRF achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing model size by over 20 times compared to 3DGS and maintaining real-time performance.

    "abstract": "Surgical simulation is essential for medical training, enabling practitioners to develop crucial skills in a risk-free environment while improving patient safety and surgical outcomes. However, conventional methods for building simulation environments are cumbersome, time-consuming, and difficult to scale, often resulting in poor details and unrealistic simulations. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based framework to directly reconstruct interactive surgical scenes from endoscopic data while ensuring efficiency, rendering quality, and realism. A key challenge in this data-driven simulation paradigm is the restricted movement of endoscopic cameras, which limits viewpoint diversity. As a result, the Gaussian Splatting representation overfits specific perspectives, leading to reduced geometric accuracy. To address this issue, we introduce a novel virtual camera-based regularization method that adaptively samples virtual viewpoints around the scene and incorporates them into the optimization process to mitigate overfitting. An effective depth-based regularization is applied to both real and virtual views to further refine the scene geometry. To enable fast deformation simulation, we propose a sparse control node-based Material Point Method, which integrates physical properties into the reconstructed scene while significantly reducing computational costs. Experimental results on representative surgical data demonstrate that our method can efficiently reconstruct and simulate surgical scenes from sparse endoscopic views. Notably, our method takes only a few minutes to reconstruct the surgical scene and is able to produce physically plausible deformations in real-time with user-defined interactions.",

This mechanism adaptively integrates depth cues from multiview geometry with learned monocular priors (Omnidata ViT), dynamically weighting their contributions based on explicit reliability estimates-derived predominantly from multi-view geometric consistency-to generate high-fidelity proxy depth for map supervision. The resulting proxy depth guides the optimization of a deformable 3DGS map, which efficiently adapts online to maintain global consistency following pose updates from a DROID-SLAM-inspired frontend and backend optimizations (loop closure, global bundle adjustment). Extensive validation on standard benchmarks (TUM-RGBD, ScanNet) and diverse custom mobile datasets demonstrates significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy (L1 depth error) and novel view synthesis fidelity (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) over baselines, particularly in challenging conditions.

Traditional methods often face limitations due to image noise and incomplete information between frames. To address these challenges, we present MedGS, a semi-supervised neural implicit surface reconstruction framework that employs a Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based interpolation mechanism. In this framework, medical imaging data are represented as consecutive two-dimensional (2D) frames embedded in 3D space and modeled using Gaussian-based distributions. This representation enables robust frame interpolation and high-fidelity surface reconstruction across imaging modalities. As a result, MedGS offers more efficient training than traditional neural implicit methods. Its explicit GS-based representation enhances noise robustness, allows flexible editing, and supports precise modeling of complex anatomical structures with fewer artifacts. These features make MedGS highly suitable for scalable and practical applications in medical imaging.",

However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization, yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of 3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous driving.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have conducted many pioneer researches on contactless fingerprints, yet the performance of contactless fingerprint recognition still lags behind contact-based methods primary due to the insufficient contactless fingerprint data with pose variations and lack of the usage of implicit 3D fingerprint representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel contactless fingerprint 3D registration, reconstruction and generation framework by integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting, with the goal of offering a new paradigm for contactless fingerprint recognition that integrates 3D fingerprint reconstruction and generation. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply 3D Gaussian Splatting to the field of fingerprint recognition, and the first to achieve effective 3D registration and complete reconstruction of contactless fingerprints with sparse input images and without requiring camera parameters information. Experiments on 3D fingerprint registration, reconstruction, and generation prove that our method can accurately align and reconstruct 3D fingerprints from 2D images, and sequentially generates high-quality contactless fingerprints from 3D model, thus increasing the performances for contactless fingerprint recognition.",

    "abstract": "The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states, which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU, leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity) improvement.",

Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using 3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly across different datasets.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos remains challenging due to insufficient geometric information in single-view observations. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise, they struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of 3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and information scarcity, we propose a novel method, \\textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that integrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian Splatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh faces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior surface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage foundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to complement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when distilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting optimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct parameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training strategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to optimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination of enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our approach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction. Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared to existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance fidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled prior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses.",

To overcome these obstacles, we propose RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

Utilizing large language models (LLMs), We construct causal graphs where nodes represent objects and attributes, while edges encode causal dependencies and physical constraints. CausalStruct iteratively refines the scene layout by enforcing causal order to determine the placement order of objects and applies causal intervention to adjust the spatial configuration according to physics-driven constraints, ensuring consistency with textual descriptions and real-world dynamics. The refined scene causal graph informs subsequent optimization steps, employing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative(PID) controller to iteratively tune object scales and positions. Our method uses text or images to guide object placement and layout in 3D scenes, with 3D Gaussian Splatting and Score Distillation Sampling improving shape accuracy and rendering stability.

    "abstract": "We present a perception-driven safety filter that converts each 3D Gaussian Splat (3DGS) into a closed-form forward collision cone, which in turn yields a first-order control barrier function (CBF) embedded within a quadratic program (QP). By exploiting the analytic geometry of splats, our formulation provides a continuous, closed-form representation of collision constraints that is both simple and computationally efficient. Unlike distance-based CBFs, which tend to activate reactively only when an obstacle is already close, our collision-cone CBF activates proactively, allowing the robot to adjust earlier and thereby produce smoother and safer avoidance maneuvers at lower computational cost. We validate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats, where our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly decreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while maintaining the same level of safety. The approach is entirely analytic, requires no high-order CBF extensions (HOCBFs), and generalizes naturally to robots with physical extent through a principled Minkowski-sum inflation of the splats. These properties make the method broadly applicable to real-time navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments, including space robotics and satellite systems.",

Unlike prior methods relying on sparse maps or inertial data, MCGS-SLAM fuses dense RGB inputs from multiple viewpoints into a unified, continuously optimized Gaussian map. A multi-camera bundle adjustment (MCBA) jointly refines poses and depths via dense photometric and geometric residuals, while a scale consistency module enforces metric alignment across views using low-rank priors. The system supports RGB input and maintains real-time performance at large scale. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that MCGS-SLAM consistently yields accurate trajectories and photorealistic reconstructions, usually outperforming monocular baselines. Notably, the wide field of view from multi-camera input enables reconstruction of side-view regions that monocular setups miss, critical for safe autonomous operation.

We attribute this issue to the unstable optimization of the Gaussians. To address this limitation, we present a plug-and-play PDE-based optimization method that overcomes the optimization constraints of 3DGS-based approaches in various tasks, such as novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction. Firstly, we theoretically derive that the 3DGS optimization procedure can be modeled as a PDE, and introduce a viscous term to ensure stable optimization. Secondly, we use the Material Point Method (MPM) to obtain a stable numerical solution of the PDE, which enhances both global and local constraints. Additionally, an effective Gaussian densification strategy and particle constraints are introduced to ensure fine-grained details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering and reconstruction quality.",

In this paper, we propose a reconstruction algorithm, namely LamiGauss, that combines Gaussian Splatting radiative rasterization with a dedicated detector-to-world transformation model incorporating the laminographic tilt angle. LamiGauss leverages an initialization strategy that explicitly filters out common laminographic artifacts from the preliminary reconstruction, preventing redundant Gaussians from being allocated to false structures and thereby concentrating model capacity on representing the genuine object. Our approach effectively optimizes directly from sparse projections, enabling accurate and efficient reconstruction with limited data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over existing techniques.

Specifically, to address redundant 3D Gaussian primitives in SLAM, we propose merging them in voxel space based on geometric similarity. This reduces GPU memory usage without impacting system runtime performance.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is rapidly gaining popularity for its photorealistic rendering quality and real-time performance, but it generates massive amounts of data. Hence compressing 3DGS data is necessary for the cost effectiveness of 3DGS models. Recently, several anchor-based neural compression methods have been proposed, achieving good 3DGS compression performance. However, they all rely on uniform scalar quantization (USQ) due to its simplicity. A tantalizing question is whether more sophisticated quantizers can improve the current 3DGS compression methods with very little extra overhead and minimal change to the system. The answer is yes by replacing USQ with lattice vector quantization (LVQ). To better capture scene-specific characteristics, we optimize the lattice basis for each scene, improving LVQ's adaptability and R-D efficiency. This scene-adaptive LVQ (SALVQ) strikes a balance between the R-D efficiency of vector quantization and the low complexity of USQ. SALVQ can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS compression architectures, enhancing their R-D performance with minimal modifications and computational overhead. Moreover, by scaling the lattice basis vectors, SALVQ can dynamically adjust lattice density, enabling a single model to accommodate multiple bit rate targets. This flexibility eliminates the need to train separate models for different compression levels, significantly reducing training time and memory consumption.",

However, this task remains fundamentally ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input, making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS) from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery.

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics. While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation, creating comprehensive \"bags of embeddings\" that holistically describe objects. This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting (GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency, achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.",

While 3D-GS has been extended to scientific visualization, prior work remains limited to single-GPU settings, restricting scalability for large datasets on high-performance computing (HPC) systems. We present a distributed 3D-GS pipeline tailored for HPC. Our approach partitions data across nodes, trains Gaussian splats in parallel using multi-nodes and multi-GPUs, and merges splats for global rendering. To eliminate artifacts, we add ghost cells at partition boundaries and apply background masks to remove irrelevant pixels. Benchmarks on the Richtmyer-Meshkov datasets (about 106.7M Gaussians) show up to 3X speedup across 8 nodes on Polaris while preserving image quality. These results demonstrate that distributed 3D-GS enables scalable visualization of large-scale scientific data and provide a foundation for future in situ applications.",

    "abstract": "Sparse-view synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of recovering accurate geometry and appearance from limited observations. While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time rendering with competitive quality, existing pipelines often rely on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for camera pose estimation, an approach that struggles in genuinely sparse-view settings. Moreover, several SfM-free methods replace SfM with multi-view stereo (MVS) models, but generate massive numbers of 3D Gaussians by back-projecting every pixel into 3D space, leading to high memory costs. We propose Segmentation-Driven Initialization for Gaussian Splatting (SDI-GS), a method that mitigates inefficiency by leveraging region-based segmentation to identify and retain only structurally significant regions. This enables selective downsampling of the dense point cloud, preserving scene fidelity while substantially reducing Gaussian count. Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that SDI-GS reduces Gaussian count by up to 50% and achieves comparable or superior rendering quality in PSNR and SSIM, with only marginal degradation in LPIPS. It further enables faster training and lower memory footprint, advancing the practicality of 3DGS for constrained-view scenarios.",

To address editing challenges in point-based representations, we explicitly separate the head and background Gaussians and use pre-trained 2D guidance to optimize the facial region across views. We further introduce a repair module to enhance visual consistency under extreme poses and expressions. Experiments on NeRSemble and additional evaluation videos demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art 2D approaches in identity preservation, as well as pose and expression consistency, while significantly outperforming them in multi-view rendering quality and 3D consistency.

Although this progress has been initiated by neural radiance fields, their slow rendering and backward mapping from the observation space to the canonical space have been the main challenges. With Gaussian splatting overcoming both challenges, a new family of approaches has emerged that are faster to train and render, while also straightforward to implement using forward skinning from the canonical to the observation space. However, the linear blend skinning required for the deformation of the Gaussians does not provide valid results for their non-linear rotation properties. To address such artifacts, recent works use mesh properties to rotate the non-linear Gaussian properties or train models to predict corrective offsets. Instead, we propose a weighted rotation blending approach that leverages quaternion averaging. This leads to simpler vertex-based Gaussians that can be efficiently animated and integrated in any engine by only modifying the linear blend skinning technique, and using any Gaussian rasterizer.",

Recent works have focused on achieving this decomposition using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation but remain hindered by two key limitations: the high computational overhead associated with neural networks of NeRF and the use of low-frequency lighting representations, which often result in inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy. We propose ROSGS, a two-stage pipeline designed to efficiently reconstruct relightable outdoor scenes using the Gaussian Splatting representation. By leveraging monocular normal priors, ROSGS first reconstructs the scene's geometry with the compact 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) representation, providing an efficient and accurate geometric foundation. Building upon this reconstructed geometry, ROSGS then decomposes the scene's texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting model. This model effectively represents typical outdoor lighting by employing a spherical Gaussian function to capture the directional, high-frequency components of sunlight, while learning a radiance transfer function via Spherical Harmonic coefficients to model the remaining low-frequency skylight comprehensively. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons demonstrate that ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting outdoor scenes and highlight its ability to deliver superior relighting accuracy and rendering efficiency.",

Existing mask-based pruning, such as MaskGS, regularizes the global mean of the mask, which is misaligned with the local per-pixel (per-ray) reconstruction loss that determines image quality along individual camera rays. This paper introduces SVR-GS, a spatially variant regularizer that renders a per-pixel spatial mask from each Gaussian's effective contribution along the ray, thereby applying sparsity pressure where it matters: on low-importance Gaussians. We explore three spatial-mask aggregation strategies, implement them in CUDA, and conduct a gradient analysis to motivate our final design. Extensive experiments on Tanks\\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that, on average across the three datasets, the proposed SVR-GS reduces the number of Gaussians by 1.79\\(\\times\\) compared to MaskGS and 5.63\\(\\times\\) compared to 3DGS, while incurring only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR drops, respectively.

However, it often struggles under sparse-view settings, producing undesirable artifacts such as floaters, inaccurate geometry, and overfitting due to limited observations. We find that a key contributing factor is uncontrolled densification, where adding Gaussian primitives rapidly without guidance can harm geometry and cause artifacts. We propose AD-GS, a novel alternating densification framework that interleaves high and low densification phases. During high densification, the model densifies aggressively, followed by photometric loss based training to capture fine-grained scene details. Low densification then primarily involves aggressive opacity pruning of Gaussians followed by regularizing their geometry through pseudo-view consistency and edge-aware depth smoothness. This alternating approach helps reduce overfitting by carefully controlling model capacity growth while progressively refining the scene representation. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that AD-GS significantly improves rendering quality and geometric consistency compared to existing methods.

To address this bottleneck, we propose 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing (4D-GRT), a novel two-stage pipeline that combines 4D Gaussian Splatting with physically-based ray tracing for camera effect simulation.

Using the SPEED+ dataset, we compare K-Planes, Gaussian Splatting, and Convex Splatting, and demonstrate that embeddings primarily reduce the number of primitives needed for explicit methods rather than enhancing geometric fidelity. Moreover, convex splatting achieves more compact and clutter-free representations than Gaussian splatting, offering advantages for safety-critical applications such as interaction and collision avoidance. Our findings clarify the limits of appearance embeddings for geometry-centric tasks and highlight trade-offs between reconstruction quality and representation efficiency in space scenarios.",

In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging viewpoints.",

    "abstract": "Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under photometric supervision.   While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision. In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage, we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.",

    "abstract": "The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter (LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components. Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images, enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely 69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used will be publicly available via our project page: https://zx-yin.github.io/dreamlifting/.",

    "abstract": "VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes. Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency, inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output, we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.",

Online 3D mapping is a proven strategy to tackle this challenge, as it enables the teleoperator to progressively explore the site from multiple perspectives.

In this work, we propose a solution to improve teleoperation efficiency in unknown environments. Our approach proposes a novel, modular and efficient GPU-based integration between recent advancement in gaussian splatting SLAM and existing online map-based teleoperation systems. We compare the proposed solution against state-of-the-art teleoperation systems and validate its performances through real-world experiments using an aerial vehicle. The results show significant improvements in decision-making speed and more accurate interaction with the environment, leading to greater teleoperation efficiency.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes, though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as 3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden scene.",

A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight, arbitrarily oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a 50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

However, those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors (e.g., normal vector), and they might also be unreliably estimated by noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view synthesis, showing that our framework, GeoSplat, significantly improves the performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.",

Full high-fidelity scene reconstruction is computationally expensive and often unnecessary when only specific points of interest (POIs) matter for timely decision making. We address this challenge with CoRe-GS, a semantic POI-focused extension of Gaussian Splatting (GS). Instead of optimizing every scene element uniformly, CoRe-GS first produces a fast segmentation-ready GS representation and then selectively refines splats belonging to semantically relevant POIs detected during data acquisition. This targeted refinement reduces training time to 25\\% compared to full semantic GS while improving novel view synthesis quality in the areas that matter most. We validate CoRe-GS on both real-world (SCRREAM) and synthetic (NeRDS 360) datasets, demonstrating that prioritizing POIs enables faster and higher-quality mobile reconstruction tailored to operational needs.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto 3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image. Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First, we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints. Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree environments.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians. However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed 3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models, directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge. ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively), while retraining close to state-of-art quality.",

Neural volumetric methods improve realism but remain too slow for interactive use. Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast, high-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for expression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry, expressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head Gaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry and appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency details such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM provides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters (e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals that capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's capacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders represent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised images for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering. To learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first dataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust disentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression transfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression accuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality, establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image processing.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization. Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data, however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and backside consistency.

While 3DGS excels on RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same, regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2) Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized, optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization, offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a promising alternative to neural radiance fields (NeRF) as it offers high speed as well as high image quality in novel view synthesis. Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still struggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based accelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting operations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical trade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively reduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary rasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG groups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across tiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During rasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small tiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG enables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping tiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with the original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is a lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be seamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental results show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over state-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators.",

AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues, however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI, particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy, combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.",

Recent breakthroughs combine SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to achieve exceptional reconstruction fidelity.

In this paper, we propose AGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework to boost the efficiency of 3DGS-SLAM based on the intuition that SLAM systems process frames in a streaming manner, where adjacent frames exhibit high similarity that can be utilized for acceleration. On the software level: 1) We propose a coarse-then-fine-grained pose tracking method with respect to the robot's movement. 2) We avoid redundant computations of Gaussians by sharing their contribution information across frames. On the hardware level, we propose a frame covisibility detection engine to extract intermediate data from the video CODEC. We also implement a pose tracking engine and a mapping engine with workload schedulers to efficiently deploy the AGS algorithm.

We propose a latent diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats, including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference. Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a regression-based formulation to predict a single \"mode\" for occluded and out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background, reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.",

Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering, there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages extreme anisotropy-specifically, \"needle-like\" shapes-by favoring more balanced, \"disk-like\" forms that are better suited for stable surface reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy (ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training, effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric, photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.",

Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects. Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting, known for enabling high-quality static scene reconstruction with fast rendering, is increasingly being applied to dynamic scene reconstruction. A common strategy involves learning a deformation field to model the temporal changes of a canonical set of 3D Gaussians. However, these deformation-based methods often produce blurred renderings and lose fine motion details in highly dynamic regions due to the inherent limitations of a single, unified model in representing diverse motion patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Motion-Aware Partitioning of Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (MAPo), a novel framework for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction. Its core is a dynamic score-based partitioning strategy that distinguishes between high- and low-dynamic 3D Gaussians. For high-dynamic 3D Gaussians, we recursively partition them temporally and duplicate their deformation networks for each new temporal segment, enabling specialized modeling to capture intricate motion details. Concurrently, low-dynamic 3DGs are treated as static to reduce computational costs. However, this temporal partitioning strategy for high-dynamic 3DGs can introduce visual discontinuities across frames at the partition boundaries. To address this, we introduce a cross-frame consistency loss, which not only ensures visual continuity but also further enhances rendering quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAPo achieves superior rendering quality compared to baselines while maintaining comparable computational costs, particularly in regions with complex or rapid motions.",

FastAvatar's core is a Large Gaussian Reconstruction Transformer featuring three key designs: First, a variant VGGT-style transformer architecture aggregating multi-frame cues while injecting initial 3D prompt to predict an aggregatable canonical 3DGS representation; Second, multi-granular guidance encoding (camera pose, FLAME expression, head pose) mitigating animation-induced misalignment for variable-length inputs; Third, incremental Gaussian aggregation via landmark tracking and sliced fusion losses. Integrating these features, FastAvatar enables incremental reconstruction, i.e., improving quality with more observations, unlike prior work wasting input data. This yields a quality-speed-tunable paradigm for highly usable avatar modeling. Extensive experiments show that FastAvatar has higher quality and highly competitive speed compared to existing methods.",

To address this limitation, we propose Label-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (LabelGS), a method that augments the Gaussian representation with object label.LabelGS introduces cross-view consistent semantic masks for 3D Gaussians and employs a novel Occlusion Analysis Model to avoid overfitting occlusion during optimization, Main Gaussian Labeling model to lift 2D semantic prior to 3D Gaussian and Gaussian Projection Filter to avoid Gaussian label conflict. Our approach achieves effective decoupling of Gaussian representations and refines the 3DGS optimization process through a random region sampling strategy, significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LabelGS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, including Feature-3DGS, in the 3D scene segmentation task.

To address these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model (EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior 3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\\%) while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency.

The framework generalizes across different scene formats without retraining, and avoids redundant computation across views. We further demonstrate a real-time interactive application on a Looking Glass display, achieving 200+ FPS at 512p across 45 views, enabling seamless, immersive 3D interaction. On standard benchmarks, our method achieves up to 22x speedup compared to independently rendering each view, while preserving image quality.",

FastAvatar uses a novel encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face ``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures. Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion, model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g., FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in consumer and interactive systems.",

    "abstract": "Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks, requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing 3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches, achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.",

    "abstract": "Surface reconstruction has been widely studied in computer vision and graphics. However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover accurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address this issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface reconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage 2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric priors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction. Specifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view pixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images and thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve the accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted Chamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping areas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the orientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal estimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed improvement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks.

    "abstract": "The emergence of 3D artificial intelligence-generated content (3D-AIGC) has enabled rapid synthesis of intricate geometries. However, a fundamental disconnect persists between AI-generated content and human-centric design paradigms, rooted in representational incompatibilities: conventional AI frameworks predominantly manipulate meshes or neural representations (\\emph{e.g.}, NeRF, Gaussian Splatting), while designers operate within parametric modeling tools. This disconnection diminishes the practical value of AI for 3D industry, undermining the efficiency of human-AI collaboration. To resolve this disparity, we focus on generating design operation sequences, which are structured modeling histories that comprehensively capture the step-by-step construction process of 3D assets and align with designers' typical workflows in modern 3D software. We first reformulate fundamental modeling operations (\\emph{e.g.}, \\emph{Extrude}, \\emph{Boolean}) into differentiable units, enabling joint optimization of continuous (\\emph{e.g.}, \\emph{Extrude} height) and discrete (\\emph{e.g.}, \\emph{Boolean} type) parameters via gradient-based learning. Based on these differentiable operations, a hierarchical graph with gating mechanism is constructed and optimized end-to-end by minimizing Chamfer Distance to target geometries. Multi-stage sequence length constraint and domain rule penalties enable unsupervised learning of compact design sequences without ground-truth sequence supervision. Extensive validation demonstrates that the generated operation sequences achieve high geometric fidelity, smooth mesh wiring, rational step composition and flexible editing capacity, with full compatibility within design industry.",

The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.",

However, the dynamic nature of battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement, with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.",

We propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy.

Directly rendering arbitrary-scale HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for 3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales, while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).",

However, acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available, we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent 3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse, the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes, resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs 3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches, achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details, resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles, pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near, middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation. Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors, whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network. The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks. This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating. Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene changes.

To address this, this paper proposes MeSS (Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure) using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.",

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these, we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.",

    "abstract": "Inferring the physical properties of 3D scenes from visual information is a critical yet challenging task for creating interactive and realistic virtual worlds. While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile, diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available. Project page: https://gsfix3d.github.io.",

    "abstract": "We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and (3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results, inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this, we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events: (4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from severely blurred inputs.",

Although NeRF-based methods achieve high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties, leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models. Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering approaches.",

Our method adapts the principles of Gaussian Splatting to the domain of ultrasound, introducing a slice-aware, differentiable rasterizer tailored to the unique physics and geometry of ultrasound imaging. We model anatomy as a collection of anisotropic 3D Gaussians and optimize their parameters directly from image-level supervision, leveraging sensorless probe motion estimation and domain-specific geometric priors. The result is a compact, flexible, and memory-efficient volumetric representation that captures anatomical detail with high spatial fidelity.

Previous studies have employed dense SLAM techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction. However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage. However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in 3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process.

They typically rely on pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image, enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets, annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute.

To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism, where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations and fine-scale texture transitions.

However, the problem of assisting humans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has received much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and dense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed by human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding of the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to guide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect view-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated visualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of a scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image coverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we leverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a vision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked objects to guide the user during scanning. Our results show superior performance in real scenes compared to conventional view sampling strategies.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in novel view synthesis under dense-view settings. However, in sparse-view scenarios, despite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests appearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance artifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current approaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to aggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real appearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance artifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed Co-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians, i.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple renderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians. The analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated as the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose two lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in sparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise injection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and their effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks. We hope that our insights into the co-adaptation effect will inspire the community to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of sparse-view 3DGS.",

However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the creation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling short of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic panorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control and synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN integrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create 360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a \\textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation, respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene reconstruction, we propose a \\textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model} based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually compelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic driving scenes from dashcam videos has attracted increasing attention due to its significance in autonomous driving and scene understanding. While recent advances have made impressive progress, most methods still unify all background elements into a single representation, hindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some approaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on pre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to discrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor scenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving scenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic driving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D feature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the 3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities and enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static codebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without requiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance segmentation in dynamic, open-world driving scenes.More visualizations are available at our project page.",

In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of handling real-world complexity.

    "abstract": "Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp., lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction, while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality, outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers comparable compression performance.",

To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).",

The two tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of 3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions, while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and decoding time.",

Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although simulation training offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation. We introduce a method for training HRT policies, focusing on human-to-robot handovers, solely from RGB images without the need for real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The goal is to enable the robot to reliably receive objects from a human with stable grasping while avoiding collisions with the human hand. The proposed policy learner leverages sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that our method serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover task, contributing to more seamless and robust HRT.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from sparse views is an ill-posed problem due to insufficient information, often resulting in noticeable artifacts. While recent approaches have sought to leverage generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they struggle to generate content that remains consistent with input observations. To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to improve the quality of 3DGS representations reconstructed from sparse inputs. The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which contains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments demonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential, but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable 3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy. It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to 1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information, overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU, respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6% communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited communication budgets.",

    "abstract": "Many methods exist for frame synthesis in image sequences but can be broadly categorised into frame interpolation and view synthesis techniques. Fundamentally, both frame interpolation and view synthesis tackle the same task, interpolating a frame given surrounding frames in time or space. However, most frame interpolation datasets focus on temporal aspects with single cameras moving through time and space, while view synthesis datasets are typically biased toward stereoscopic depth estimation use cases. This makes direct comparison between view synthesis and frame interpolation methods challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel multi-camera dataset using a custom-built dense linear camera array to enable fair comparison between these approaches. We evaluate classical and deep learning frame interpolators against a view synthesis method (3D Gaussian Splatting) for the task of view in-betweening. Our results reveal that deep learning methods do not significantly outperform classical methods on real image data, with 3D Gaussian Splatting actually underperforming frame interpolators by as much as 3.5 dB PSNR. However, in synthetic scenes, the situation reverses -- 3D Gaussian Splatting outperforms frame interpolation algorithms by almost 5 dB PSNR at a 95% confidence level.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control. Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact scene representations with 50\\% reduced memory consumption through optimized Gaussians utilization.",

    "abstract": "Realizing low-cost communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR (GSMR), which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a photo-realistic view from the robot's pose by calling ``memory'' from a GS model, thus reducing the need for excessive image uploads. However, the GS model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments. To this end, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or not) and power allocation (i.e., adjusting to content profiles) across different frames by minimizing a newly derived GSMR loss function. The GSCLO problem is addressed by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm that reduces computational complexity by over $10$x compared to traditional branch-and-bound and search algorithms. Moreover, variants of GSCLO are presented to achieve robust, low-power, and multi-robot GSMR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSMR paradigm and GSCLO method achieve significant improvements over existing benchmarks on both wheeled and legged robots in terms of diverse metrics in various scenarios. For the first time, it is found that RoboMR can be achieved with ultra-low communication costs, and mixture of data is useful for enhancing GS performance in dynamic scenarios.",

Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU) benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of 2D video foundation models to the 3D domain.

However, Current data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality labeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data science. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios. Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality. Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.",

To guide the touch exploration, we introduce a two-stage sampling scheme that initially probes sparse regions and then concentrates on high-uncertainty boundaries identified from the reconstructed mesh. A geometric loss is proposed to ensure surface smoothness, resulting in improved geometry. Experimental results across diverse scenarios show consistent improvements in geometric accuracy.

This method achieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by constraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the reconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view distance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian alignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same Gaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement module, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel points in nearby views and calculating the loss.

I created a dataset of images from a real-world scene and constructed 3D models using both methods. To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the USAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the development of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and enhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the Blender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality novel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My investigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original ground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting. This augmented dataset was employed to generate a new photogrammetry model, which was then compared against the original photogrammetry model created using only the original images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian Splatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve photogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions. The comparative analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of both approaches, providing valuable information for applications in extended reality (XR), photogrammetry, and autonomous vehicle simulations.

We then lift the animation model from 2D to 3D through introducing dual-attention module together with camera prior to generate multi-view videos with spatial-temporal and spatial-view consistency. Finally, we employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on these multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character representations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we construct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique characters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple viewpoints. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark, CharacterBench, demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a leading 3D scene reconstruction method, obtaining high-quality reconstruction with real-time rendering runtime performance. The main idea behind 3DGS is to represent the scene as a collection of 3D gaussians, while learning their parameters to fit the given views of the scene. While achieving superior performance in the presence of many views, 3DGS struggles with sparse view reconstruction, where the input views are sparse and do not fully cover the scene and have low overlaps. In this paper, we propose DIP-GS, a Deep Image Prior (DIP) 3DGS representation. By using the DIP prior, which utilizes internal structure and patterns, with coarse-to-fine manner, DIP-based 3DGS can operate in scenarios where vanilla 3DGS fails, such as sparse view recovery. Note that our approach does not use any pre-trained models such as generative models and depth estimation, but rather relies only on the input frames. Among such methods, DIP-GS obtains state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitive results on various sparse-view reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated its effectiveness in photo-realistic rendering and 3D reconstruction. Among these, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is particularly suitable for surface reconstruction due to its flattened Gaussian representation and integrated normal regularization. However, its performance often degrades in large-scale and complex urban scenes with frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete building reconstructions. We propose GS4Buildings, a novel prior-guided Gaussian Splatting method leveraging the ubiquity of semantic 3D building models for robust and scalable building surface reconstruction. Instead of relying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings initializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic 3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the planar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process, providing strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural accuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits reconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian primitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation. Experiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves reconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%. These results highlight the potential of semantic building model integration to advance GS-based reconstruction toward real-world urban applications such as smart cities and digital twins.

However, the robustness of these watermarking techniques against potential attacks remains underexplored. This paper introduces the first universal black-box attack framework, the Group-based Multi-objective Evolutionary Attack (GMEA), designed to challenge these watermarking systems. We formulate the attack as a large-scale multi-objective optimization problem, balancing watermark removal with visual quality. In a black-box setting, we introduce an indirect objective function that blinds the watermark detector by minimizing the standard deviation of features extracted by a convolutional network, thus rendering the feature maps uninformative. To manage the vast search space of 3DGS models, we employ a group-based optimization strategy to partition the model into multiple, independent sub-optimization problems. Experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively removes both 1D and 2D watermarks from mainstream 3DGS watermarking methods while maintaining high visual fidelity. This work reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing 3DGS copyright protection schemes and calls for the development of more robust watermarking systems.",

Many fruits are fragile and prone to bruising, thus requiring humans to manually harvest them with care. In this work, we demonstrate by using optical tactile sensing, autonomous manipulation of fruit with minimal damage can be achieved. We show that our tactile informed diffusion policies outperform baselines in both reduced bruising and pick-and-place success rate across three fruits: strawberries, tomatoes, and blackberries. In addition, we introduce FruitSplat, a novel technique to represent and quantify visual damage in high-resolution 3D representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Existing metrics for measuring damage lack quantitative rigor or require expensive equipment. With FruitSplat, we distill a 2D strawberry mask as well as a 2D bruise segmentation mask into the 3DGS representation. Furthermore, this representation is modular and general, compatible with any relevant 2D model. Overall, we demonstrate a 92% grasping policy success rate, up to a 20% reduction in visual bruising, and up to an 31% improvement in grasp success rate on challenging fruit compared to our baselines across our three tested fruits.

However, existing GS-SLAM systems perform poorly under persistent and severe motion blur commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, leading to significantly degraded tracking accuracy and compromised 3D reconstruction quality. To address this limitation, we propose EGS-SLAM, a novel GS-SLAM framework that fuses event data with RGB-D inputs to simultaneously reduce motion blur in images and compensate for the sparse and discrete nature of event streams, enabling robust tracking and high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Specifically, our system explicitly models the camera's continuous trajectory during exposure, supporting event- and blur-aware tracking and mapping on a unified 3D Gaussian Splatting scene. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable camera response function to align the dynamic ranges of events and images, along with a no-event loss to suppress ringing artifacts during reconstruction. We validate our approach on a new dataset comprising synthetic and real-world sequences with significant motion blur. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EGS-SLAM consistently outperforms existing GS-SLAM systems in both trajectory accuracy and photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction.

Our study covers both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with 200 degree fisheye cameras and analyzes how each method handles extreme distortion in real world settings. We evaluate performance under varying fields of view (200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between peripheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of view (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable across all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200 degree view. To address the limitations of SfM-based initialization, which often fails under strong distortion, we also propose a depth-based strategy using UniK3D predictions from only 2-3 fisheye images per scene. Although UniK3D is not trained on real fisheye data, it produces dense point clouds that enable reconstruction quality on par with SfM, even in difficult scenes with fog, glare, or sky. Our results highlight the practical viability of fisheye-based 3DGS methods for wide-angle 3D reconstruction from sparse and distortion-heavy image inputs.",

    "abstract": "Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions), they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.",

We introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.",

    "abstract": "The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation. Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple metrics.",

    "abstract": "The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and 3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization. This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2 minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer methods. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/FastSplatStyler.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes.

    "abstract": "Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore, to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes. Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.",

We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.",

However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering. Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method achieves 3.27\\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.",

Traditional estimation techniques fundamentally fail under mobility, with feedback delays as small as 4 ms causing 50% throughput degradation at even modest speeds (30 km/h). We present neural Gaussian radio fields (nGRF), a novel framework that leverages explicit 3D Gaussian primitives to synthesize complex channel matrices accurately and efficiently. Unlike NeRF-based approaches that rely on slow implicit representations or existing Gaussian splatting methods that use non-physical 2D projections, nGRF performs direct 3D electromagnetic field aggregation, with each Gaussian acting as a localized radio modulator. nGRF demonstrates superior performance across diverse environments: in indoor scenarios, it achieves a 10.9$\\times$ higher prediction SNR than state of the art methods while reducing inference latency from 242 ms to just 1.1 ms (a 220$\\times$ speedup). For large-scale outdoor environments, where existing approaches fail to function, nGRF achieves an SNR of 26.2 dB. Moreover, nGRF requires only 0.011 measurements per cubic foot compared to 0.2-178.1 for existing methods, thereby reducing data collection burden by 18$\\times$. Training time is similarly reduced from hours to minutes (a 180$\\times$ reduction), enabling rapid adaptation to dynamic environments.

    "abstract": "As a critical modality for structural biology, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) facilitates the determination of macromolecular structures at near-atomic resolution. The core computational task in single-particle cryo-EM is to reconstruct the 3D electrostatic potential of a molecule from noisy 2D projections acquired at unknown orientations. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) provide a continuous, compact, and physically interpretable representation for molecular density and have recently gained interest in cryo-EM reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on external consensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their use in self-contained pipelines. In parallel, differentiable rendering techniques such as Gaussian splatting have demonstrated remarkable scalability and efficiency for volumetric representations, suggesting a natural fit for GMM-based cryo-EM reconstruction. However, off-the-shelf Gaussian splatting methods are designed for photorealistic view synthesis and remain incompatible with cryo-EM due to mismatches in the image formation physics, reconstruction objectives, and coordinate systems. Addressing these issues, we propose cryoSplat, a GMM-based method that integrates Gaussian splatting with the physics of cryo-EM image formation. In particular, we develop an orthogonal projection-aware Gaussian splatting, with adaptations such as a view-dependent normalization term and FFT-aligned coordinate system tailored for cryo-EM imaging. These innovations enable stable and efficient homogeneous reconstruction directly from raw cryo-EM particle images using random initialization. Experimental results on real datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of cryoSplat over representative baselines. The code will be released upon publication.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video remains fundamentally challenging due to the need to jointly infer motion, structure, and appearance from limited observations. Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based on Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and interpretability. To address this, we propose \\textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion separation.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.",

To overcome this, we introduce Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation boundaries.

We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\\\"ucker coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement.

In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward 3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views, enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further improving the quality of 3D representations.

However, representing scenes requires a large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS, a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering quality.

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features. Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation, bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering.

Despite its strengths, 3DGS often produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we propose \\textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS), which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion, effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of 1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset.

UE is crucial for using Gaussian Splatting in critical applications such as robotics and medicine. Previous methods typically estimate the variance of Gaussian primitives and use the rendering process to obtain pixel-wise uncertainties. Our method establishes primitive representations of error and visibility of trainings views, which carries meaningful uncertainty information. This representation is obtained by projection of training error and visibility onto the primitives. Uncertainties of novel views are obtained by rendering the primitive representations of uncertainty for those novel views, yielding uncertainty feature maps. To aggregate these uncertainty feature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout data. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method, investigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression models. Furthermore, we considered the effect of separating splatting into foreground and background.

However, existing methods rely on the average gradient magnitude of points within the view, often leading to severe needle-like artifacts under sparse-view conditions. To address this challenge, we propose GR-Gaussian, a graph-based 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that suppresses needle-like artifacts and improves reconstruction accuracy under sparse-view conditions. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a Denoised Point Cloud Initialization Strategy that reduces initialization errors and accelerates convergence; and (2) a Pixel-Graph-Aware Gradient Strategy that refines gradient computation using graph-based density differences, improving splitting accuracy and density representation. Experiments on X-3D and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of GR-Gaussian, achieving PSNR improvements of 0.67 dB and 0.92 dB, and SSIM gains of 0.011 and 0.021. These results highlight the applicability of GR-Gaussian for accurate CT reconstruction under challenging sparse-view conditions.",

    "abstract": "The significance of informative and robust point representations has been widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance, the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency, achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting the effectiveness of our approach.

However, existing approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of articulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve complex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting their practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce ScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot, text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.

While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses, and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view synthesis over baseline approaches.",

The recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components: Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently, during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch.

Classical approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \\textbf{DisCo3D}, a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing quality.",

Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space, scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes, making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation tasks.",

However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.",

We propose Omni-Scan, a pipeline for producing high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat models using a bi-manual robot that grasps an object with one gripper and rotates the object with respect to a stationary camera. The object is then re-grasped by a second gripper to expose surfaces that were occluded by the first gripper. We present the Omni-Scan robot pipeline using DepthAny-thing, Segment Anything, as well as RAFT optical flow models to identify and isolate objects held by a robot gripper while removing the gripper and the background. We then modify the 3DGS training pipeline to support concatenated datasets with gripper occlusion, producing an omni-directional (360 degree view) model of the object. We apply Omni-Scan to part defect inspection, finding that it can identify visual or geometric defects in 12 different industrial and household objects with an average accuracy of 83%.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting, and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space. Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

    "abstract": "3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents. Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens, guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.",

    "abstract": "High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering (VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views. To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%, 34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.",

We propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.",

In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed.",

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors learned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained model augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a Gaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians derived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to render accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new training strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of favorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google Scanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate the effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality rendering of 3D scenes and is getting increasing adoption in domains like autonomous driving and embodied intelligence. However, 3DGS still faces major efficiency challenges when faced with high frame rate requirements and resource-constrained edge deployment. To enable efficient 3DGS, in this paper, we propose LS-Gaussian, an algorithm/hardware co-design framework for lightweight streaming 3D rendering. LS-Gaussian is motivated by the core observation that 3DGS suffers from substantial computation redundancy and stalls. On one hand, in practical scenarios, high-frame-rate 3DGS is often applied in settings where a camera observes and renders the same scene continuously but from slightly different viewpoints. Therefore, instead of rendering each frame separately, LS-Gaussian proposes a viewpoint transformation algorithm that leverages inter-frame continuity for efficient sparse rendering. On the other hand, as different tiles within an image are rendered in parallel but have imbalanced workloads, frequent hardware stalls also slow down the rendering process. LS-Gaussian predicts the workload for each tile based on viewpoint transformation to enable more balanced parallel computation and co-designs a customized 3DGS accelerator to support the workload-aware mapping in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate that LS-Gaussian achieves 5.41x speedup over the edge GPU baseline on average and up to 17.3x speedup with the customized accelerator, while incurring only minimal visual quality degradation.",

This is achieved through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation.

    "abstract": "In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding. Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For registration, it achieves a 41.9\\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB, highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and autonomous navigation.",

    "abstract": "Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion, perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading, reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and 2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for realistic and consistent video editing.

However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space, promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.",

We use Gaussian primitives as both a geometric representation and texture field samplers, efficiently splatting texture features into image space. Our evaluation demonstrates that this disentanglement enables high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail reconstruction, and easy textured mesh extraction, all while using significantly fewer primitives.",

Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection. 3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in leveraging large-scale Internet photo collections for 3D reconstruction have enabled immersive virtual exploration of landmarks and historic sites worldwide. However, little attention has been given to the immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which remains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we draw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use unconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for understanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we extend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel framework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo collections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the same viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance field, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language feature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the multi-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next, we propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance language field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively compress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally, to quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark dataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained photo collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling applications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries, architectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing.",

One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering. Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache. This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.",

Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2) a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3) and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize 3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques. This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision, the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.",

Existing plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality.

To address these challenges, we present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate unstable deformation artifacts.

(2) Increased parameters for dynamic scenes elevate sorting latency and energy consumption. (3) Limited on-chip buffer capacity with higher parameters reduces buffer reuse, causing frequent DRAM access. (4) Dynamic 3DGS operations are not readily compatible with digital compute-in-memory (DCIM). These challenges hinder real-time performance and power efficiency on edge devices, leading to reduced battery life or requiring bulky batteries. To tackle these challenges, we propose algorithm-hardware co-design techniques. At the algorithmic level, we introduce three optimizations: (1) DRAM-access reduction frustum culling to lower DRAM access overhead, (2) Adaptive tile grouping to enhance on-chip buffer reuse, and (3) Adaptive interval initialization Bucket-Bitonic sort to reduce sorting latency. At the hardware level, we present a DCIM-friendly computation flow that is evaluated using the measured data from a 16nm DCIM prototype chip. Our experimental results on Large-Scale Real-World Static/Dynamic Datasets demonstrate the ability to achieve high frame rate real-time rendering exceeding 200 frame per second (FPS) with minimal power consumption, merely 0.28 W for static Large-Scale Real-World scenes and 0.63 W for dynamic Large-Scale Real-World scenes. This work successfully addresses the significant challenges of implementing static/dynamic 3DGS technology on resource-constrained edge devices.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) effectively synthesizes novel views through its flexible representation, yet fails to accurately reconstruct scene geometry. While modern variants like PGSR introduce additional losses to ensure proper depth and normal maps through Gaussian fusion, they still neglect individual placement optimization. This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement, enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel Gaussian-based 3D environments. Extensive experiments validate GSSR's effectiveness, showing enhanced geometric accuracy while preserving high-quality rendering performance.",

    "abstract": "High-fidelity sensor simulation of light-based sensors such as cameras and LiDARs is critical for safe and accurate autonomy testing. Neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors, preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes, and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable simulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/",

Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically, we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS reconstruction.",

In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core, MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior 4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D generation from minimal inputs.",

This effectively models the local surface as a 2D Gaussian disk aligned with the underlying geometry, leading to more consistent depth interpretation across multiple viewpoints compared to conventional 3D ellipsoid-based representations with isotropic uncertainty. To integrate this representation into the SLAM pipeline, we embed the surface-aligned Gaussian disks into a Generalized ICP framework by introducing anisotropic covariance prior without altering the underlying registration formulation. Furthermore we propose a geometry-aware loss that supervises photometric, depth, and normal consistency. Our system achieves real-time operation while preserving both visual and geometric fidelity.

To fill this gap, we introduce the Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry. Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals. We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis, relighting, and material and shape editing.

This approach yields significantly improved compression ratios and provides a user-controlled balance between compression efficiency and rendering quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 91$\\times$ compression compared to the original Ex4DGS model while maintaining high visual fidelity.

Each scene provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1) Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications, from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data priors from Aerial-Earth3D.

    "abstract": "Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is essential for applications in which dense image acquisition is impractical, such as robotics, augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), and autonomous systems. In these settings, minimal image overlap prevents reliable correspondence matching, causing traditional methods, such as structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS), to fail. This survey reviews the latest advances in neural implicit models (e.g., NeRF and its regularized versions), explicit point-cloud-based approaches (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting), and hybrid frameworks that leverage priors from diffusion and vision foundation models (VFMs).We analyze how geometric regularization, explicit shape modeling, and generative inference are used to mitigate artifacts such as floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings. Comparative results on standard benchmarks reveal key trade-offs between the reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Unlike previous reviews, our survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural implicit, and generative (diffusion-based) methods. We highlight the persistent challenges in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction and outline future directions for developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis, but its application to online long-sequence scenarios is still limited. Existing methods either rely on slow per-scene optimization or fail to provide efficient incremental updates, hindering continuous performance. In this paper, we propose LongSplat, an online real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction framework designed for long-sequence image input. The core idea is a streaming update mechanism that incrementally integrates current-view observations while selectively compressing redundant historical Gaussians. Crucial to this mechanism is our Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR), a representation that encodes 3D Gaussian parameters into a structured, image-like 2D format. GIR simultaneously enables efficient fusion of current-view and historical Gaussians and identity-aware redundancy compression. These functions enable online reconstruction and adapt the model to long sequences without overwhelming memory or computational costs. Furthermore, we leverage an existing image compression method to guide the generation of more compact and higher-quality 3D Gaussians. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LongSplat achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-quality trade-offs in real-time novel view synthesis, delivering real-time reconstruction while reducing Gaussian counts by 44\\% compared to existing per-pixel Gaussian prediction methods.",

While frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.",

    "abstract": "Visual relocalization, which estimates the 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) camera pose from query images, is fundamental to remote sensing and UAV applications. Existing methods face inherent trade-offs: image-based retrieval and pose regression approaches lack precision, while structure-based methods that register queries to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) models suffer from computational complexity and limited scalability. These challenges are particularly pronounced in remote sensing scenarios due to large-scale scenes, high altitude variations, and domain gaps of existing visual priors. To overcome these limitations, we leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a novel scene representation that compactly encodes both 3D geometry and appearance. We introduce $\\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc, a dual-hierarchical relocalization framework that follows a sparse-to-dense and coarse-to-fine paradigm, fully exploiting the rich semantic information and geometric constraints inherent in Gaussian primitives. To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate partitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic memory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse stage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy and landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation, and (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine dense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification. Through comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real flight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive localization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while effectively filtering unreliable pose estimates. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach for practical remote sensing applications.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown its detailed expressive ability and highly efficient rendering speed in the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. The application to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the discrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry constraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra continuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian primitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing memory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a discretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by encoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us to link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity transformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the computational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the discrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete representation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal loss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and enforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based consistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher relighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding complex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method outperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF.",

Instead of treating the scene as a unified whole, ObjectGS models individual objects as local anchors that generate neural Gaussians and share object IDs, enabling precise object-level reconstruction. During training, we dynamically grow or prune these anchors and optimize their features, while a one-hot ID encoding with a classification loss enforces clear semantic constraints.

We also propose an alpha-based boundary identification method to derive compact and accurate Gaussian regions, thereby reducing rendering costs. We implement our GCC accelerator in 28nm technology.

Human modeling represents pedestrians in 3D space by fusing multiview information, making its quality crucial for detection accuracy. However, existing methods often introduce noise and have low precision. While some approaches reduce noise by fitting on costly multiview 3D annotations, they often struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. To eliminate reliance on human-labeled annotations and accurately model humans, we propose Depth-Consistent Human Modeling (DCHM), a framework designed for consistent depth estimation and multiview fusion in global coordinates. Specifically, our proposed pipeline with superpixel-wise Gaussian Splatting achieves multiview depth consistency in sparse-view, large-scaled, and crowded scenarios, producing precise point clouds for pedestrian localization. Extensive validations demonstrate that our method significantly reduces noise during human modeling, outperforming previous state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, to our knowledge, DCHM is the first to reconstruct pedestrians and perform multiview segmentation in such a challenging setting.

    "abstract": "The advent of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has significantly enhanced the quality of volumetric video representation. Meanwhile, in contrast to conventional volumetric video, 3DGS video poses significant challenges for streaming due to its substantially larger data volume and the heightened complexity involved in compression and transmission. To address these issues, we introduce an innovative framework for 3DGS volumetric video streaming. Specifically, we design a 3DGS video construction method based on the Gaussian deformation field. By employing hybrid saliency tiling and differentiated quality modeling of 3DGS video, we achieve efficient data compression and adaptation to bandwidth fluctuations while ensuring high transmission quality. Then we build a complete 3DGS video streaming system and validate the transmission performance. Through experimental evaluation, our method demonstrated superiority over existing approaches in various aspects, including video quality, compression effectiveness, and transmission rate.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents Neural-GASh, a novel real-time shading pipeline for 3D meshes, that leverages a neural radiance field architecture to perform image-based rendering (IBR) using Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA)-encoded vertex information as input. Unlike traditional Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) methods, that require expensive offline precomputations, our learned model directly consumes CGA-based representations of vertex positions and normals, enabling dynamic scene shading without precomputation. Integrated seamlessly into the Unity engine, Neural-GASh facilitates accurate shading of animated and deformed 3D meshes - capabilities essential for dynamic, interactive environments. The shading of the scene is implemented within Unity, where rotation of scene lights in terms of Spherical Harmonics is also performed optimally using CGA. This neural field approach is designed to deliver fast and efficient light transport simulation across diverse platforms, including mobile and VR, while preserving high rendering quality. Additionally, we evaluate our method on scenes generated via 3D Gaussian splats, further demonstrating the flexibility and robustness of Neural-GASh in diverse scenarios. Performance is evaluated in comparison to conventional PRT, demonstrating competitive rendering speeds even with complex geometries.",

However, it often struggles to handle scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and 3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in volume visualization (VolVis) focus on extracting insights from 3D volumetric data by generating visually compelling renderings that reveal complex internal structures. Existing VolVis approaches have explored non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness, and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives, extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes, resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and editing flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Visualization of large-scale time-dependent simulation data is crucial for domain scientists to analyze complex phenomena, but it demands significant I/O bandwidth, storage, and computational resources. To enable effective visualization on local, low-end machines, recent advances in view synthesis techniques, such as neural radiance fields, utilize neural networks to generate novel visualizations for volumetric scenes. However, these methods focus on reconstruction quality rather than facilitating interactive visualization exploration, such as feature extraction and tracking. We introduce VolSegGS, a novel Gaussian splatting framework that supports interactive segmentation and tracking in dynamic volumetric scenes for exploratory visualization and analysis. Our approach utilizes deformable 3D Gaussians to represent a dynamic volumetric scene, allowing for real-time novel view synthesis. For accurate segmentation, we leverage the view-independent colors of Gaussians for coarse-level segmentation and refine the results with an affinity field network for fine-level segmentation. Additionally, by embedding segmentation results within the Gaussians, we ensure that their deformation enables continuous tracking of segmented regions over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VolSegGS with several time-varying datasets and compare our solutions against state-of-the-art methods. With the ability to interact with a dynamic scene in real time and provide flexible segmentation and tracking capabilities, VolSegGS offers a powerful solution under low computational demands. This framework unlocks exciting new possibilities for time-varying volumetric data analysis and visualization.",

In this system, we introduce a multi-level pose regression strategy that progressively estimates and refines the pose of query image from the global 3DGS map, without requiring initial pose priors. Moreover, we introduce a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm that establishes correspondences between 2D (image) and 3D (3DGS map). By matching the extracted scene semantic descriptors of 2D query image and 3DGS semantic representation, we align the image with the local region of the global 3DGS map, thereby obtaining a coarse pose estimation. Subsequently, we refine the coarse pose by iteratively optimizing the difference between the query image and the rendered image from 3DGS. Our SGLoc demonstrates superior performance over baselines on 12scenes and 7scenes datasets, showing excellent capabilities in global localization without initial pose prior.

Event cameras, with their high-dynamic range and high-speed properties, have the potential to mitigate these issues. Additionally, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables radiance field reconstruction, facilitating bright frame synthesis from multiple viewpoints in low-light conditions. However, naively using an event-assisted 3D GS approach still faced challenges because, in low light, events are noisy, frames lack quality, and the color tone may be inconsistent. To address these issues, we propose Dark-EvGS, the first event-assisted 3D GS framework that enables the reconstruction of bright frames from arbitrary viewpoints along the camera trajectory. Triplet-level supervision is proposed to gain holistic knowledge, granular details, and sharp scene rendering. The color tone matching block is proposed to guarantee the color consistency of the rendered frames. Furthermore, we introduce the first real-captured dataset for the event-guided bright frame synthesis task via 3D GS-based radiance field reconstruction.

However, existing 3DGS approaches usually generate plausible outputs and face significant challenges in complex scene reconstruction, manifesting as incomplete holistic structural outlines and unclear local lighting effects. To address these issues simultaneously, we propose a novel decoupled optimization framework, which integrates wavelet decomposition into 3D Gaussian Splatting and 2D sampling. Technically, through 3D wavelet decomposition, our approach divides point clouds into high-frequency and low-frequency components, enabling targeted optimization for each. The low-frequency component captures global structural outlines and manages the distribution of Gaussians through voxelization. In contrast, the high-frequency component restores intricate geometric and textural details while incorporating a relight module to mitigate lighting artifacts and enhance photorealistic rendering. Additionally, a 2D wavelet decomposition is applied to the training images, simulating radiance variations. This provides critical guidance for high-frequency detail reconstruction, ensuring seamless integration of details with the global structure. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, surpassing existing approaches and advancing the field of 3D scene reconstruction.",

However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes in the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type of splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent object surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that this can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality. Thus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian Splatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its surface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first propose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and rendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. In addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based initialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its surface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging different types of primitives.

To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions, ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting. Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning. TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore, despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\\delta} < 2.5 cm accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D neural representations and instance-level editing models have enabled the efficient creation of high-quality 3D content. However, achieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian Splatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently ambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction (3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits. Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local 3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

This is a challenging problem particularly when rendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures and expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads, including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple locally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable creating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In contrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we condition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and synthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a patch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how to translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling the patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene representation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians on-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ color-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality results and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images. By leveraging patch-level expressions, ScaffoldAvatar consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion, while encompassing diverse facial expressions and styles in real time.",

    "abstract": "Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world environments. Existing 2D and 3D physical attacks, due to their focus on texture optimization, often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture optimization, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module that filters outliers to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module that simulates complex physical scenarios to enhance attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21\\% to 7.38\\%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks.",

    "abstract": "Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation. Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes. We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects and {\\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover task.",

    "abstract": "Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.",

Traditional 3D reconstruction methods typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.",

However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a 3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space. Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the $\\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view synthesis.

These approaches demonstrate efficacy in a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods.

First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and memory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple 3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric backbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex motions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively grows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing redundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer anchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\\% reduction in model size and an average of 100\\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality.",

Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild scenes.

FlexGaussian eliminates the need for retraining and adapts easily to diverse compression targets. Evaluation results show that FlexGaussian achieves up to 96.4% compression while maintaining high rendering quality (<1 dB drop in PSNR), and is deployable on mobile devices. FlexGaussian delivers high compression ratios within seconds, being 1.7-2.1x faster than state-of-the-art training-free methods and 10-100x faster than training-involved approaches.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce LangSplatV2, which achieves high-dimensional feature splatting at 476.2 FPS and 3D open-vocabulary text querying at 384.6 FPS for high-resolution images, providing a 42 $\\times$ speedup and a 47 $\\times$ boost over LangSplat respectively, along with improved query accuracy. LangSplat employs Gaussian Splatting to embed 2D CLIP language features into 3D, significantly enhancing speed and learning a precise 3D language field with SAM semantics. Such advancements in 3D language fields are crucial for applications that require language interaction within complex scenes. However, LangSplat does not yet achieve real-time inference performance (8.2 FPS), even with advanced A100 GPUs, severely limiting its broader application. In this paper, we first conduct a detailed time analysis of LangSplat, identifying the heavyweight decoder as the primary speed bottleneck. Our solution, LangSplatV2 assumes that each Gaussian acts as a sparse code within a global dictionary, leading to the learning of a 3D sparse coefficient field that entirely eliminates the need for a heavyweight decoder. By leveraging this sparsity, we further propose an efficient sparse coefficient splatting method with CUDA optimization, rendering high-dimensional feature maps at high quality while incurring only the time cost of splatting an ultra-low-dimensional feature. Our experimental results demonstrate that LangSplatV2 not only achieves better or competitive query accuracy but is also significantly faster.

However, achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures, followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices. Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.",

    "abstract": "Accurately rendering scenes with reflective surfaces remains a significant challenge in novel view synthesis, as existing methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often misinterpret reflections as physical geometry, resulting in degraded reconstructions. Previous methods rely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to misalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene geometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the accumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in blurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose Ref-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected components to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric consistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch representation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency reflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo reflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we incorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness constraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms classical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with NeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs) driven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes. Our code is available at https://ref-unlock.github.io/.",

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have enabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple scene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits generalizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing temporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame motions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors are compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model that combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate estimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion compensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent fidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS generalizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods, achieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression for dynamic 3DGS, paving the way for scalable FVV transmission and storage in immersive applications.",

Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose 3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation. Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads, boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization capabilities even in challenging urban environments where GNSS fails.",

Inspired by recent probabilistic rendering approaches, we introduce BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty estimation in neural implicit 3D representations. Unlike radiance-based models such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting, Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) provide continuous, differentiable surface representations, making them especially well-suited for uncertainty-aware modeling. BayesSDF applies a Laplace approximation over SDF weights and derives Hessian-based metrics to estimate local geometric instability. We empirically demonstrate that these uncertainty estimates correlate strongly with surface reconstruction error across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. By enabling surface-aware uncertainty quantification, BayesSDF lays the groundwork for more robust, interpretable, and actionable 3D perception systems.",

However, the multi-view editing often exhibits significant local inconsistency, especially in areas of non-rigid deformation, which lead to local artifacts, texture blurring, or semantic variations in edited 3D scenes. We also found that the existing editing methods, which rely entirely on text prompts make the editing process a \"one-shot deal\", making it difficult for users to control the editing degree flexibly. In response to these challenges, we present InterGSEdit, a novel framework for high-quality 3DGS editing via interactively selecting key views with users' preferences. We propose a CLIP-based Semantic Consistency Selection (CSCS) strategy to adaptively screen a group of semantically consistent reference views for each user-selected key view. Then, the cross-attention maps derived from the reference views are used in a weighted Gaussian Splatting unprojection to construct the 3D Geometry-Consistent Attention Prior ($GAP^{3D}$). We project $GAP^{3D}$ to obtain 3D-constrained attention, which are fused with 2D cross-attention via Attention Fusion Network (AFN). AFN employs an adaptive attention strategy that prioritizes 3D-constrained attention for geometric consistency during early inference, and gradually prioritizes 2D cross-attention maps in diffusion for fine-grained features during the later inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterGSEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering consistent, high-fidelity 3DGS editing with improved user experience.",

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) significantly transforms immersive digital interfaces, greatly enhancing education, professional practices, and entertainment by increasing user engagement and opening up new possibilities in various industries. Among its numerous applications, image rendering is crucial. Nevertheless, rendering methodologies like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose high computational demands, driven predominantly by user expectations for superior visual quality. This results in notable processing delays for real-time image rendering, which greatly affects the user experience. Additionally, VR devices such as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual behavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user experience. These insights have spurred the development of foveated rendering, a technique that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution based on the user's gaze direction. The resultant solution, known as gaze-tracked foveated rendering, significantly reduces the computational burden of the rendering process.   Although gaze-tracked foveated rendering can reduce rendering costs, the computational overhead of the gaze tracking process itself can sometimes outweigh the rendering savings, leading to increased processing latency. To address this issue, we propose an efficient rendering framework called~\\textit{A3FR}, designed to minimize the latency of gaze-tracked foveated rendering via the parallelization of gaze tracking and foveated rendering processes. For the rendering algorithm, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting, a state-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Evaluation results demonstrate that A3FR can reduce end-to-end rendering latency by up to $2\\times$ while maintaining visual quality.",

The resulting map enables high-quality, real-time novel view rendering of both RGB images and depth maps. To effectively address under-reconstruction in regions not covered by the LiDAR, we employ a lightweight zero-shot depth model that synergistically combines RGB appearance cues with sparse LiDAR measurements to generate dense depth maps. The depth completion enables reliable Gaussian initialization in LiDAR-blind areas, significantly improving system applicability for sparse LiDAR sensors. To enhance geometric accuracy, we use sparse but precise LiDAR depths to supervise Gaussian map optimization and accelerate it with carefully designed CUDA-accelerated strategies. Furthermore, we explore how the incrementally reconstructed Gaussian map can improve the robustness of odometry. By tightly incorporating photometric constraints from the Gaussian map into the continuous-time factor graph optimization, we demonstrate improved pose estimation under LiDAR degradation scenarios. We also showcase downstream applications via extending our elaborate system, including video frame interpolation and fast 3D mesh extraction. To support rigorous evaluation, we construct a dedicated LiDAR-Inertial-Camera dataset featuring ground-truth poses, depth maps, and extrapolated trajectories for assessing out-of-sequence novel view synthesis. Both the dataset and code will be made publicly available on project page https://xingxingzuo.github.io/gaussian_lic2.",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on modeling dynamic urban environments for autonomous driving simulation. Contemporary data-driven methods using neural radiance fields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer from low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D Gaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, these approaches often neglect to model fine-grained variations between frames and camera viewpoints, leading to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose a new approach named ArmGS that exploits composite driving Gaussian splatting with multi-granularity appearance refinement for autonomous driving scene modeling. The core idea of our approach is devising a multi-level appearance modeling scheme to optimize a set of transformation parameters for composite Gaussian refinement from multiple granularities, ranging from local Gaussian level to global image level and dynamic actor level. This not only models global scene appearance variations between frames and camera viewpoints, but also models local fine-grained changes of background and objects. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging autonomous driving datasets, namely, Waymo, KITTI, NOTR and VKITTI2, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods.",

However, some previous 3DGS SLAM methods employ a differentiable rendering pipeline for tracking, lack geometric priors in outdoor scenes. Other approaches introduce separate tracking modules, but they accumulate errors with significant camera movement, leading to scale drift. To address these challenges, we propose a robust RGB-only outdoor 3DGS SLAM method: S3PO-GS. Technically, we establish a self-consistent tracking module anchored in the 3DGS pointmap, which avoids cumulative scale drift and achieves more precise and robust tracking with fewer iterations. Additionally, we design a patch-based pointmap dynamic mapping module, which introduces geometric priors while avoiding scale ambiguity. This significantly enhances tracking accuracy and the quality of scene reconstruction, making it particularly suitable for complex outdoor environments. Our experiments on the Waymo, KITTI, and DL3DV datasets demonstrate that S3PO-GS achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and outperforms other 3DGS SLAM methods in tracking accuracy.

    "abstract": "We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations, complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However, splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'. This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular reflections.",

In this work, we introduce ArtGS, a novel framework that extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by integrating visual-physical modeling for articulated object understanding and interaction. ArtGS begins with multi-view RGB-D reconstruction, followed by reasoning with a vision-language model (VLM) to extract semantic and structural information, particularly the articulated bones. Through dynamic, differentiable 3DGS-based rendering, ArtGS optimizes the parameters of the articulated bones, ensuring physically consistent motion constraints and enhancing the manipulation policy. By leveraging dynamic Gaussian splatting, cross-embodiment adaptability, and closed-loop optimization, ArtGS establishes a new framework for efficient, scalable, and generalizable articulated object modeling and manipulation. Experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that ArtGS significantly outperforms previous methods in joint estimation accuracy and manipulation success rates across a variety of articulated objects.

Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application. In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes.

    "abstract": "Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons, prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available at:https://github.com/TRLou/PGA.",

The robot navigates its environment by planning receding-horizon trajectories that prioritize semantic similarity to the query and exploration of unseen regions of the environment. To evaluate trajectories, VISTA introduces a novel, efficient viewpoint-semantic coverage metric that quantifies both the geometric view diversity and task relevance in the 3D scene. On static datasets, our coverage metric outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, FisherRF and Bayes' Rays, in computation speed and reconstruction quality. In quadrotor hardware experiments, VISTA achieves 6x higher success rates in challenging maps, compared to baseline methods, while matching baseline performance in less challenging maps.

However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on partitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at chunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly suited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with street-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU memory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce A LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale Gaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our method stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a Level-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the relevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with Sequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a lightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to support real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable seamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex scenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details.",

Our method employs visibility masks derived from optimized 3D Gaussian splats to exclude areas not visible from the source view during training.

Our approach directly embeds rich linguistic features into the 3D scene representation by associating language with each Gaussian primitive, achieving early modality alignment. To process the resulting dense representations, we introduce a dual sparsifier that distills them into compact, task-relevant tokens via task-guided and location-guided pathways, producing sparse, task-aware global and local scene tokens. Notably, we present the first Gaussian splatting-based VLM, leveraging photorealistic 3D representations derived from standard RGB images, demonstrating strong generalization: it improves performance of prior 3D VLM five folds, in out-of-the-domain settings.",

Existing approaches primarily rely on low-pass filtering to mitigate aliasing. However, these methods are not sensitive to the sampling rate, often resulting in under-filtering and over-smoothing renderings. To address this limitation, we propose LOD-GS, a Level-of-Detail-sensitive filtering framework for Gaussian Splatting, which dynamically predicts the optimal filtering strength for each 3D Gaussian primitive. Specifically, we introduce a set of basis functions to each Gaussian, which take the sampling rate as input to model appearance variations, enabling sampling-rate-sensitive filtering. These basis function parameters are jointly optimized with the 3D Gaussian in an end-to-end manner. The sampling rate is influenced by both focal length and camera distance. However, existing methods and datasets rely solely on down-sampling to simulate focal length changes for anti-aliasing evaluation, overlooking the impact of camera distance. To enable a more comprehensive assessment, we introduce a new synthetic dataset featuring objects rendered at varying camera distances. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering quality while effectively eliminating aliasing.

Gaussian Splatting is an alternative for rendering realistic images while supporting real-time performance, and it has gained popularity due to its explicit 3D Gaussian representation. However, 3DGS heavily depends on accurate initialization and faces difficulties in optimizing unstructured Gaussian distributions into ordered surfaces, with limited adaptive density control mechanism proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a geometry-guided initialization to predict Gaussian parameters, ensuring precise placement and faster convergence. We then introduce a surface-aligned optimization strategy to refine Gaussian placement, improving geometric accuracy and aligning with the surface normals of the scene. Finally, we present a dynamic adaptive density control mechanism that adjusts Gaussian density based on regional complexity, for visual fidelity. These innovations enable our method to achieve high-fidelity real-time rendering and significant improvements in visual quality, even in complex scenes. Our method demonstrates comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods, rendering high-fidelity images in real time.",

    "abstract": "While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds, with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior, our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics simulations or animation.",

To address these issues, we introduce \\textbf{GaVS}, a novel 3D-grounded approach that reformulates video stabilization as a temporally-consistent `local reconstruction and rendering' paradigm. Given 3D camera poses, we augment a reconstruction model to predict Gaussian Splatting primitives, and finetune it at test-time, with multi-view dynamics-aware photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization, to produce temporally-consistent local reconstructions. The model are then used to render each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid frame cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with 3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene dynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics and new geometry consistency.

The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic surgical scenes in real-time.

Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments, underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications.

To address these challenges, we propose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality mapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable pairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust geometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric Constraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary geometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose estimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For mapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes geometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized Gaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust mechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on multiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our method improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 69.0\\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality.

Typically, existing methods adopt unified representation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal features of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm fails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame imaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects. To address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various latent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between background and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal disentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the cumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal discrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous dynamic scene.

However, existing methods focus primarily on geometric and appearance modeling, lacking deeper scene understanding while also incurring high training costs that complicate the originally streamlined differentiable rendering pipeline. To this end, we propose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates Hough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized for instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We then embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets construct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth distortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For open-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D point clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with high-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D instance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object localization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies.

    "abstract": "The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges, we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.",

    "abstract": "3D Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in radiotherapy but suffers from motion artifacts due to breathing. A common clinical approach mitigates this by sorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per phase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT instead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion without phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) offer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to dynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane, use implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While explicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial regularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these limitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis function and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by coupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and rotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six CBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over HexPlane. These results highlight the potential of deformation-informed 4DGS for efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction. The code is available at https://github.com/Yuliang-Huang/DIGS.",

Most existing methods rely on object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and move them during the rendering process.

To address this challenge, we propose B\\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting (B\\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using learnable B\\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling, automatically corrects pose errors.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting. However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank. Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\\sim}70$K 360{\\deg} car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding 3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as demonstrated in our experiments.

    "abstract": "Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both static and dynamic surgical scenes.",

Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric detail. To tackle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly integrates geometry and perception information without requiring additional model training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically, we incorporate geometry and perception priors to initialize the Gaussian branches and guide their parameter optimization. The geometry prior captures the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we introduce a stable Score Distillation Sampling for fine-grained prior distillation to ensure effective knowledge transfer. The model is further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth consistency. Experimental results show that we outperform existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.",

This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art.

To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid rendering framework that combines rasterization and ray tracing to achieve efficient and high-fidelity clipping of Gaussian Splatting data. At the core of our method is the RaRa strategy, which first leverages rasterization to quickly identify Gaussians intersected by the clipping plane, followed by ray tracing to compute attenuation weights based on their partial occlusion. These weights are then used to accurately estimate each Gaussian's contribution to the final image, enabling smooth and continuous clipping effects. We validate our approach on diverse datasets, including general Gaussians, hair strand Gaussians, and multi-layer Gaussians, and conduct user studies to evaluate both perceptual quality and quantitative performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method delivers visually superior results while maintaining real-time rendering performance and preserving high fidelity in the unclipped regions.",

However, the intricate electromagnetic scattering mechanisms inherent to SAR imaging pose significant reconstruction challenges. Inspired by the remarkable success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) in optical domain reconstruction, this paper presents a novel SAR Differentiable Gaussian Splatting Rasterizer (SDGR) specifically designed for SAR target reconstruction. Our approach combines Gaussian splatting with the Mapping and Projection Algorithm to compute scattering intensities of Gaussian primitives and generate simulated SAR images through SDGR. Subsequently, the loss function between the rendered image and the ground truth image is computed to optimize the Gaussian primitive parameters representing the scene, while a custom CUDA gradient flow is employed to replace automatic differentiation for accelerated gradient computation. Through experiments involving the rendering of simplified architectural targets and SAR images of multiple vehicle targets, we validate the imaging rationality of SDGR on simulated SAR imagery. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our method for target reconstruction is demonstrated on both simulated and real-world datasets containing multiple vehicle targets, with quantitative evaluations conducted to assess its reconstruction performance. Experimental results indicate that our approach can effectively reconstruct the geometric structures and scattering properties of targets, thereby providing a novel solution for 3D reconstruction in the field of SAR imaging.",

    "abstract": "Multi-task robotic bimanual manipulation is becoming increasingly popular as it enables sophisticated tasks that require diverse dual-arm collaboration patterns. Compared to unimanual manipulation, bimanual tasks pose challenges to understanding the multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics. An existing method ManiGaussian pioneers encoding the spatiotemporal dynamics into the visual representation via Gaussian world model for single-arm settings, which ignores the interaction of multiple embodiments for dual-arm systems with significant performance drop. In this paper, we propose ManiGaussian++, an extension of ManiGaussian framework that improves multi-task bimanual manipulation by digesting multi-body scene dynamics through a hierarchical Gaussian world model. To be specific, we first generate task-oriented Gaussian Splatting from intermediate visual features, which aims to differentiate acting and stabilizing arms for multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics modeling. We then build a hierarchical Gaussian world model with the leader-follower architecture, where the multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics is mined for intermediate visual representation via future scene prediction. The leader predicts Gaussian Splatting deformation caused by motions of the stabilizing arm, through which the follower generates the physical consequences resulted from the movement of the acting arm. As a result, our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art bimanual manipulation techniques by an improvement of 20.2% in 10 simulated tasks, and achieves 60% success rate on average in 9 challenging real-world tasks.

It establishes Gaussians as core rendering primitives for highly accurate real-world environment reconstruction. Recent advances have drastically increased the size of scenes that can be created. In this work, we present a method for rendering large and complex 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes using virtual memory. By leveraging well-established virtual memory and virtual texturing techniques, our approach efficiently identifies visible Gaussians and dynamically streams them to the GPU just in time for real-time rendering. Selecting only the necessary Gaussians for both storage and rendering results in reduced memory usage and effectively accelerates rendering, especially for highly complex scenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how level of detail can be integrated into our proposed method to further enhance rendering speed for large-scale scenes. With an optimized implementation, we highlight key practical considerations and thoroughly evaluate the proposed technique and its impact on desktop and mobile devices.",

Unlike prior 4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF pipelines, which struggle with training overhead in minute-long captures, our method leverages invertible Gaussian Splatting deformation networks to reconstruct large-scale, dynamic environments accurately. Specifically, we decompose each scene into a static background plus time-varying objects, each represented by learned Gaussian primitives undergoing global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and subtle non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from various embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete canonical foreground shape (\\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may involve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors. Our experiments demonstrate that \\ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction quality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs.

Multi-agent Gaussian SLAM is a promising approach to rapid exploration and reconstruction of environments, offering scalable environment representations, but existing approaches are limited to small-scale, indoor environments. To that end, we propose Gaussian Reconstruction via Multi-Agent Dense SLAM, or GRAND-SLAM, a collaborative Gaussian splatting SLAM method that integrates i) an implicit tracking module based on local optimization over submaps and ii) an approach to inter- and intra-robot loop closure integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework. Experiments show that GRAND-SLAM provides state-of-the-art tracking performance and 28% higher PSNR than existing methods on the Replica indoor dataset, as well as 91% lower multi-agent tracking error and improved rendering over existing multi-agent methods on the large-scale, outdoor Kimera-Multi dataset.",

This task is particularly challenging when relying on monocular video, where disentangling structure from motion is ill-posed and supervision is scarce. We introduce Video Diffusion-Aware Reconstruction (ViDAR), a novel 4D reconstruction framework that leverages personalised diffusion models to synthesise a pseudo multi-view supervision signal for training a Gaussian splatting representation. By conditioning on scene-specific features, ViDAR recovers fine-grained appearance details while mitigating artefacts introduced by monocular ambiguity. To address the spatio-temporal inconsistency of diffusion-based supervision, we propose a diffusion-aware loss function and a camera pose optimisation strategy that aligns synthetic views with the underlying scene geometry. Experiments on DyCheck, a challenging benchmark with extreme viewpoint variation, show that ViDAR outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in visual quality and geometric consistency. We further highlight ViDAR's strong improvement over baselines on dynamic regions and provide a new benchmark to compare performance in reconstructing motion-rich parts of the scene.

Our ELO-based ranking system provides reliable model assessment, with the platform becoming an established evaluation resource.   Through analysis of this preference data, we present insights into human preference patterns. Our findings reveal preferences for visual presentation features, with Gaussian splat outputs achieving a 16.6 ELO advantage over meshes and textured models receiving a 144.1 ELO advantage over untextured models.

These challenges hinder the application in aerial surveying and autonomous driving. This paper proposes a novel solution to reconstruct large-scale surfaces with fine details, supervised by full-sized images. Firstly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy to reconstruct a coarse model efficiently, followed by adaptive scene partitioning and sub-scene refining from image segments. Additionally, we integrate a decoupling appearance model to capture global appearance variations and a transient mask model to mitigate interference from moving objects. Finally, we expand the multi-view constraint and introduce a single-view regularization for texture-less areas. Our experiments were conducted on the publicly available dataset GauU-Scene V2, which was captured using unmanned aerial vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms existing NeRF-based and Gaussian-based methods, achieving high-fidelity visual results and accurate surface from full-size image optimization.

To address these limitations, the emerging field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) extends classical 2D Low-Level Vision tasks including super-resolution (SR), deblurring, weather degradation removal, restoration, and enhancement into the 3D spatial domain. This survey, referred to as R\\textsuperscript{3}eVision, provides a comprehensive overview of robust rendering, restoration, and enhancement for 3D LLV by formalizing the degradation-aware rendering problem and identifying key challenges related to spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization. Recent methods that integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks are categorized to illustrate how they enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions. Application domains such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics are also discussed, where reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs is critical.

We first investigate two emerging nonlinear data transformation frameworks for image compression: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and 2D Gaussian Splatting (GS). We analyze their representational properties, behavior under lossy compression, and convergence dynamics. Our results highlight key trade-offs between INR's compact, resolution-flexible neural field representations and GS's highly parallelizable, spatially interpretable fitting, providing insights for future hybrid and compression-aware frameworks. Next, we introduce the textual transform that enables efficient compression at ultra-low bitrate regimes and simultaneously enhances human perceptual satisfaction. When combined with the concept of denoising via lossy compression, the textual transform becomes a powerful tool for denoising tasks. Finally, we present a Lempel-Ziv (LZ78) \"transform\", a universal method that, when applied to any member of a broad compressor family, produces new compressors that retain the asymptotic universality guarantees of the LZ78 algorithm. Collectively, these three transforms illuminate the fundamental trade-offs between coding efficiency and computational cost. We discuss how these insights extend beyond compression to tasks such as classification, denoising, and generative AI, suggesting new pathways for using non-linear transformations to balance resource constraints and performance.",

Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes, while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators, particularly in scenarios with limited camera views.

Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.",

A lifelike talking head requires synchronized coordination of subject identity, lip movements, facial expressions, and head poses. The absence of these synchronizations is a fundamental flaw, leading to unrealistic results. To address the critical issue of synchronization, identified as the ''devil'' in creating realistic talking heads, we introduce SyncTalk++, which features a Dynamic Portrait Renderer with Gaussian Splatting to ensure consistent subject identity preservation and a Face-Sync Controller that aligns lip movements with speech while innovatively using a 3D facial blendshape model to reconstruct accurate facial expressions. To ensure natural head movements, we propose a Head-Sync Stabilizer, which optimizes head poses for greater stability. Additionally, SyncTalk++ enhances robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) audio by incorporating an Expression Generator and a Torso Restorer, which generate speech-matched facial expressions and seamless torso regions. Our approach maintains consistency and continuity in visual details across frames and significantly improves rendering speed and quality, achieving up to 101 frames per second.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising approach for novel view synthesis, offering real-time rendering with high visual fidelity. However, its substantial storage requirements present significant challenges for practical applications. While recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DGS methods increasingly incorporate dedicated compression modules, there is a lack of a comprehensive framework to evaluate their perceptual impact. Therefore we present 3DGS-IEval-15K, the first large-scale image quality assessment (IQA) dataset specifically designed for compressed 3DGS representations. Our dataset encompasses 15,200 images rendered from 10 real-world scenes through 6 representative 3DGS algorithms at 20 strategically selected viewpoints, with different compression levels leading to various distortion effects. Through controlled subjective experiments, we collect human perception data from 60 viewers. We validate dataset quality through scene diversity and MOS distribution analysis, and establish a comprehensive benchmark with 30 representative IQA metrics covering diverse types. As the largest-scale 3DGS quality assessment dataset to date, our work provides a foundation for developing 3DGS specialized IQA metrics, and offers essential data for investigating view-dependent quality distribution patterns unique to 3DGS.

    "abstract": "Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS) for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network, named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods. Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400 times speedup along with over 50\\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional training.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made significant strides in real-time 3D scene reconstruction, but faces memory scalability issues in high-resolution scenarios. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Gaussian Splatting (HRGS), a memory-efficient framework with hierarchical block-level optimization. First, we generate a global, coarse Gaussian representation from low-resolution data. Then, we partition the scene into multiple blocks, refining each block with high-resolution data. The partitioning involves two steps: Gaussian partitioning, where irregular scenes are normalized into a bounded cubic space with a uniform grid for task distribution, and training data partitioning, where only relevant observations are retained for each block. By guiding block refinement with the coarse Gaussian prior, we ensure seamless Gaussian fusion across adjacent blocks. To reduce computational demands, we introduce Importance-Driven Gaussian Pruning (IDGP), which computes importance scores for each Gaussian and removes those with minimal contribution, speeding up convergence and reducing memory usage. Additionally, we incorporate normal priors from a pretrained model to enhance surface reconstruction quality. Our method enables high-quality, high-resolution 3D scene reconstruction even under memory constraints. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that HRGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution novel view synthesis (NVS) and surface reconstruction tasks.",

Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we adopt a V-4D-A framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing 4D modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF provides three interrelated outputs: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of init action via Gaussian motion. Furthermore, we employ an action-vision-aligned denoising framework, conditioned on a unified representation that combines the init action and the Gaussian perception, both generated by the GAF, to further obtain more precise actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR, +0.3864 SSIM and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average +7.3% success rate in robotic manipulation tasks over state-of-the-art methods.",

Recent feed-forward approaches enable efficient single-image reconstruction but struggle to effectively leverage multiple input images to reduce ambiguity and improve reconstruction accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose PF-LHM, a large human reconstruction model that generates high-quality 3D avatars in seconds from one or multiple casually captured pose-free images. Our approach introduces an efficient Encoder-Decoder Point-Image Transformer architecture, which fuses hierarchical geometric point features and multi-view image features through multimodal attention. The fused features are decoded to recover detailed geometry and appearance, represented using 3D Gaussian splats. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method unifies single- and multi-image 3D human reconstruction, achieving high-fidelity and animatable 3D human avatars without requiring camera and human pose annotations.

    "abstract": "Recent methods, such as 2D Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian Opacity Fields, have aimed to address the geometric inaccuracies of 3D Gaussian Splatting while retaining its superior rendering quality. However, these approaches still struggle to reconstruct smooth and reliable geometry, particularly in scenes with significant color variation across viewpoints, due to their per-point appearance modeling and single-view optimization constraints. In this paper, we propose an effective multiview geometric regularization strategy that integrates multiview stereo (MVS) depth, RGB, and normal constraints into Gaussian Splatting initialization and optimization. Our key insight is the complementary relationship between MVS-derived depth points and Gaussian Splatting-optimized positions: MVS robustly estimates geometry in regions of high color variation through local patch-based matching and epipolar constraints, whereas Gaussian Splatting provides more reliable and less noisy depth estimates near object boundaries and regions with lower color variation. To leverage this insight, we introduce a median depth-based multiview relative depth loss with uncertainty estimation, effectively integrating MVS depth information into Gaussian Splatting optimization. We also propose an MVS-guided Gaussian Splatting initialization to avoid Gaussians falling into suboptimal positions. Extensive experiments validate that our approach successfully combines these strengths, enhancing both geometric accuracy and rendering quality across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.",

Our framework overcomes these limitations by reformulating densification and pruning as a probabilistic sampling process, dynamically inserting and relocating Gaussians based on aggregated multi-view errors and opacity scores. Guided by Bayesian acceptance tests derived from these error-based importance scores, our method substantially reduces reliance on heuristics, offers greater flexibility, and adaptively infers Gaussian distributions without requiring predefined scene complexity. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep Blending, show that our approach reduces the number of Gaussians needed, enhancing computational efficiency while matching or modestly surpassing the view-synthesis quality of state-of-the-art models.",

Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or physical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong scene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve reconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their reliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries hinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Gaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in modeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF reconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian splatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under single-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated rasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP to model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing mobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the efficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in angle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) prediction. Experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic indoor scenes demonstrate that SwiftWRF can reconstruct WRF spectra up to 500x faster than existing state-of-the-art methods, while significantly enhancing its signal quality.

Currently, the common approach in 3DGS is to utilize \"single-view\" mini-batch training, where only one image is processed per iteration, in contrast to NeRF's \"multi-view\" mini-batch training, which leverages multiple images. We observe that such single-view training can lead to suboptimal optimization due to increased variance in mini-batch stochastic gradients, highlighting the necessity for multi-view training. However, implementing multi-view training in 3DGS poses challenges. Simply rendering multiple images per iteration incurs considerable overhead and may result in suboptimal Gaussian densification due to its reliance on single-view assumptions. To address these issues, we modify the rasterization process to minimize the overhead associated with multi-view training and propose a 3D distance-aware D-SSIM loss and multi-view adaptive density control that better suits multi-view scenarios.

    "abstract": "We tackle the challenge of generating dynamic 4D scenes from monocular, multi-object videos with heavy occlusions, and introduce GenMOJO, a novel approach that integrates rendering-based deformable 3D Gaussian optimization with generative priors for view synthesis. While existing models perform well on novel view synthesis for isolated objects, they struggle to generalize to complex, cluttered scenes. To address this, GenMOJO decomposes the scene into individual objects, optimizing a differentiable set of deformable Gaussians per object. This object-wise decomposition allows leveraging object-centric diffusion models to infer unobserved regions in novel viewpoints. It performs joint Gaussian splatting to render the full scene, capturing cross-object occlusions, and enabling occlusion-aware supervision. To bridge the gap between object-centric priors and the global frame-centric coordinate system of videos, GenMOJO uses differentiable transformations that align generative and rendering constraints within a unified framework. The resulting model generates 4D object reconstructions over space and time, and produces accurate 2D and 3D point tracks from monocular input. Quantitative evaluations and perceptual human studies confirm that GenMOJO generates more realistic novel views of scenes and produces more accurate point tracks compared to existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for novel view synthesis. However, existing methods struggle to adaptively optimize the distribution of Gaussian primitives based on scene characteristics, making it challenging to balance reconstruction quality and efficiency. Inspired by human perception, we propose scene-adaptive perceptual densification for Gaussian Splatting (Perceptual-GS), a novel framework that integrates perceptual sensitivity into the 3DGS training process to address this challenge. We first introduce a perception-aware representation that models human visual sensitivity while constraining the number of Gaussian primitives. Building on this foundation, we develop a perceptual sensitivity-adaptive distribution to allocate finer Gaussian granularity to visually critical regions, enhancing reconstruction quality and robustness. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, including BungeeNeRF for large-scale scenes, demonstrate that Perceptual-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction quality, efficiency, and robustness.

Objects such as pliers, clamps, or cabinets require representations that capture not only geometry and color information, but also part seperation, connectivity, and joint parametrization. Furthermore, learning these representations becomes even more difficult with each additional degree of freedom. Complex articulated objects such as robot arms may have seven or more degrees of freedom, and the depth of their kinematic tree may be notably greater than the tools, drawers, and cabinets that are the typical subjects of articulated object research. To address these concerns, we introduce SPLATART - a pipeline for learning Gaussian splat representations of articulated objects from posed images, of which a subset contains image space part segmentations. SPLATART disentangles the part separation task from the articulation estimation task, allowing for post-facto determination of joint estimation and representation of articulated objects with deeper kinematic trees than previously exhibited. In this work, we present data on the SPLATART pipeline as applied to the syntheic Paris dataset objects, and qualitative results on a real-world object under spare segmentation supervision. We additionally present on articulated serial chain manipulators to demonstrate usage on deeper kinematic tree structures.",

We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer and decouples dynamic-static objects optimization for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarsegrained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. On the other hand, we decouple dynamic and static objects by leveraging semantic probability distributions and design a Dynamic-Static Decoupled Gaussian Attention mechanism to optimize the prediction performance for both dynamic objects and static scenes. GraphGSOcc achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, OpenOcc and KITTI occupancy benchmarks.

However, 2DGS suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our method introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object space Mip filter by leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space of each splat.",

Existing 3DGS approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation, we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism, allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.",

Feed-forward scene reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded 3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D tracking methods.",

Existing compaction approaches address this by pruning Gaussians based on heuristic importance scores, without global fidelity guarantee.

Specifically, we first minimize the composite transport divergence over a KD-tree partition to produce a compact geometric representation, and then decouple appearance from geometry by fine-tuning color and opacity attributes with far fewer Gaussian primitives.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time rendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due to the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion representations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in existing methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision, and weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively hinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these limitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured and consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It first identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppresses redundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided Deformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation, eliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained deformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor resolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level transformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate that HAIF-GS significantly outperforms prior dynamic 3DGS methods in rendering quality, temporal coherence, and reconstruction efficiency.",

Using neural networks trained on large-scale multi-view datasets, it can directly infer 3DGS representations from sparse input views. Although the feedforward approach achieves high reconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D Gaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization are not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this limitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for generating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward 3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that systematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce View-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by projecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy by aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis transformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an off-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100x compression for 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods. Compared to the state-of-the-art compression approach, we achieve comparable quality with only 6% of the storage size. Meanwhile, our compression framework requires only 25% of the encoding time and 1% of the decoding time.",

Building upon the observation that driving scenes can be universally decomposed into static and dynamic counterparts, we define dual Gaussian queries to better model the diverse scene objects. We utilize a hierarchical Gaussian transformer to predict the occupied voxel centers and semantic classes along with the Gaussian parameters. Leveraging the real-time rendering capability of 3D Gaussian Splatting, we also impose rendering supervision with available depth and semantic map annotations injecting pixel-level alignment to boost occupancy learning. Extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo benchmarks demonstrate our proposed method sets new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low inference cost.",

    "abstract": "We propose a feed-forward Gaussian Splatting model that unifies 3D scene and semantic field reconstruction. Combining 3D scenes with semantic fields facilitates the perception and understanding of the surrounding environment. However, key challenges include embedding semantics into 3D representations, achieving generalizable real-time reconstruction, and ensuring practical applicability by using only images as input without camera parameters or ground truth depth. To this end, we propose UniForward, a feed-forward model to predict 3D Gaussians with anisotropic semantic features from only uncalibrated and unposed sparse-view images. To enable the unified representation of the 3D scene and semantic field, we embed semantic features into 3D Gaussians and predict them through a dual-branch decoupled decoder. During training, we propose a loss-guided view sampler to sample views from easy to hard, eliminating the need for ground truth depth or masks required by previous methods and stabilizing the training process. The whole model can be trained end-to-end using a photometric loss and a distillation loss that leverages semantic features from a pre-trained 2D semantic model. At the inference stage, our UniForward can reconstruct 3D scenes and the corresponding semantic fields in real time from only sparse-view images. The reconstructed 3D scenes achieve high-quality rendering, and the reconstructed 3D semantic field enables the rendering of view-consistent semantic features from arbitrary views, which can be further decoded into dense segmentation masks in an open-vocabulary manner. Experiments on novel view synthesis and novel view segmentation demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances for unifying 3D scene and semantic field reconstruction.",

To this end, we introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily long video streams.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) for point cloud pre-training has become a cornerstone for many 3D vision tasks, enabling effective learning from large-scale unannotated data. At the scene level, existing SSL methods often incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in 2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct 3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.",

Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could harness strong data priors.

Existing methods typically partition large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86 dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Recent extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to dynamic scenes achieve high-quality novel view synthesis by using neural networks to predict the time-varying deformation of each Gaussian. However, performing per-Gaussian neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper, we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses. Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\\times$, reduce model size by $7.71\\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset. SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\\times$ and $58.23\\times$ on the D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets. Our methods are modular and can be integrated into any deformable 3DGS or 4DGS framework.",

    "abstract": "Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential. Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast, neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2 significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see https://research.zenseact.com/publications/R3D2/.",

However, its performance significantly degrades in wide-baseline scenarios due to limited texture details and geometric inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose ProSplat, a two-stage feed-forward framework designed for high-fidelity rendering under wide-baseline conditions. The first stage involves generating 3D Gaussian primitives via a 3DGS generator. In the second stage, rendered views from these primitives are enhanced through an improvement model. Specifically, this improvement model is based on a one-step diffusion model, further optimized by our proposed Maximum Overlap Reference view Injection (MORI) and Distance-Weighted Epipolar Attention (DWEA). MORI supplements missing texture and color by strategically selecting a reference view with maximum viewpoint overlap, while DWEA enforces geometric consistency using epipolar constraints. Additionally, we introduce a divide-and-conquer training strategy that aligns data distributions between the two stages through joint optimization. We evaluate ProSplat on the RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K datasets under wide-baseline settings. Experimental results demonstrate that ProSplat achieves an average improvement of 1 dB in PSNR compared to recent SOTA methods.",

While recent methods leverage powerful novel view synthesis (NVS) techniques, such as three-dimensional Gaussian splatting (3DGS), they typically rely on randomly sampling multiple viewpoints or trajectories to ensure comprehensive coverage of discriminative visual cues. This approach, however, creates significant redundancy through overlapping image samples and lacks principled view selection, substantially increasing both rendering and comparison overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel IIN framework with a hierarchical scoring paradigm that estimates optimal viewpoints for target matching. Our approach integrates cross-level semantic scoring, utilizing CLIP-derived relevancy fields to identify regions with high semantic similarity to the target object class, with fine-grained local geometric scoring that performs precise pose estimation within promising regions.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for high-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields such as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies. First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design, effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process, we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we introduce a $\\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\\sim27.8\\times$ and energy savings of $28.8\\sim51.4\\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes. We plan to open-source our design to foster further development in this field.",

However, regions with complex textures require numerous Gaussians to capture significant color variations accurately, leading to inefficiencies in rendering speed. To address this challenge, we introduce a hybrid representation for indoor scenes that combines 3DGS with textured meshes. Our approach uses textured meshes to handle texture-rich flat areas, while retaining Gaussians to model intricate geometries. The proposed method begins by pruning and refining the extracted mesh to eliminate geometrically complex regions. We then employ a joint optimization for 3DGS and mesh, incorporating a warm-up strategy and transmittance-aware supervision to balance their contributions seamlessly.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the hybrid representation maintains comparable rendering quality and achieves superior frames per second FPS with fewer Gaussian primitives.",

Most notably, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems show high NVS performance; however, many current approaches are limited to static scenes. While recent works have started addressing short-term dynamics (motion within the view of the camera), long-term dynamics (the scene evolving through changes out of view) remain less explored. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dynamic scene adaptation mechanism that continuously updates the 3D representation to reflect the latest changes. In addition, since maintaining geometric and semantic consistency remains challenging due to stale observations disrupting the reconstruction process, we propose a novel keyframe management mechanism that discards outdated observations while preserving as much information as possible. We evaluate Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes (GaME) on both synthetic and real-world datasets and find it to be more accurate than the state of the art.",

Enabling 3D reconstruction and radiance field recovery from such SPC data holds significant promise. However, the binary nature of SPC images leads to severe information loss, particularly in texture and color, making traditional 3D synthesis techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose a modular two-stage framework that converts binary SPC images into high-quality colorized novel views. The first stage performs image-to-image (I2I) translation using generative models such as Pix2PixHD, converting binary SPC inputs into plausible RGB representations. The second stage employs 3D scene reconstruction techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate novel views. We validate our two-stage pipeline (Pix2PixHD + Nerf/3DGS) through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality and geometric consistency over the alternative baseline.",

While 3D Gaussian Splatting(GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we employ a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve memory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.",

However, recent 3DGS-based models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies. Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying. To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations. Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D scenes.",

While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved rendering quality and efficiency, existing methods still face fundamental challenges, including time-consuming per-subject optimization and poor generalization under sparse monocular inputs. In this work, we present the Parametric Gaussian Human Model (PGHM), a generalizable and efficient framework that integrates human priors into 3DGS for fast and high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from monocular videos. PGHM introduces two core components: (1) a UV-aligned latent identity map that compactly encodes subject-specific geometry and appearance into a learnable feature tensor; and (2) a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net that predicts Gaussian attributes by decomposing static, pose-dependent, and view-dependent components via conditioned decoders. This design enables robust rendering quality under challenging poses and viewpoints, while allowing efficient subject adaptation without requiring multi-view capture or long optimization time. Experiments show that PGHM is significantly more efficient than optimization-from-scratch methods, requiring only approximately 20 minutes per subject to produce avatars with comparable visual quality, thereby demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world monocular avatar creation.",

In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location. Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.",

Our key observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction, registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances.

To overcome these limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry. Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.",

    "abstract": "Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints, we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity, facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction.

To address this challenge, we propose Lumina, a hardware-algorithm co-designed system, which integrates two principal optimizations: a novel algorithm, S^2, and a radiance caching mechanism, RC, to improve the efficiency of neural rendering. S2 algorithm exploits temporal coherence in rendering to reduce the computational overhead, while RC leverages the color integration process of 3DGS to decrease the frequency of intensive rasterization computations. Coupled with these techniques, we propose an accelerator architecture, LuminCore, to further accelerate cache lookup and address the fundamental inefficiencies in Rasterization. We show that Lumina achieves 4.5x speedup and 5.3x energy reduction against a mobile Volta GPU, with a marginal quality loss (< 0.2 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio reduction) across synthetic and real-world datasets.",

In this paper, we analyze these challenges and their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

Nonetheless, pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete. SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes. To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives, storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint. We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.",

Our approach first learns an interpolation model to generate accurate Gaussian trajectories within the observed window, then trains a Transformer encoder to aggregate past trajectories into a latent state evolved via a neural ODE. Finally, numerical integration produces smooth, physically plausible future Gaussian trajectories, enabling rendering at arbitrary future timestamps. On the D-NeRF, NVFi, and HyperNeRF benchmarks, ODE-GS achieves state-of-the-art extrapolation performance, improving metrics by 19.8% compared to leading baselines, demonstrating its ability to accurately represent and predict 3D scene dynamics.",

This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map, our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results.

However, in real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.",

This challenge is particularly pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data. Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training data.",

We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans. We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans.

Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of 91.35\\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed better than models trained on real-world data.

Existing methods often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings (e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image 3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization. Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches, establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation.",

Existing methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device.

    "abstract": "3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail, accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality. We will make the code and dataset available.",

    "abstract": "Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated with closed-loop simulations ($R^2=0.8$) than the best existing open-loop approach ($R^2=0.7$). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim.",

However, 3DGS demands relatively significant GPU memory, limiting its use on devices with restricted computational resources. Previous approaches have focused on pruning less important Gaussians, effectively compressing 3DGS but often requiring a fine-tuning stage and lacking adaptability for the specific memory needs of different devices. In this work, we present an elastic inference method for 3DGS. Given an input for the desired model size, our method selects and transforms a subset of Gaussians, achieving substantial rendering performance without additional fine-tuning. We introduce a tiny learnable module that controls Gaussian selection based on the input percentage, along with a transformation module that adjusts the selected Gaussians to complement the performance of the reduced model. Comprehensive experiments on ZipNeRF, MipNeRF and Tanks\\&Temples scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available at https://flexgs.github.io.",

Real robot data suffers from occlusions, noisy camera poses, dynamic scene elements, which hinder the creation of geometrically accurate and photorealistic digital twins of unseen objects. We introduce a novel real-to-sim framework tackling all these challenges at once. Our key insight is a hybrid scene representation merging the photorealistic rendering of 3D Gaussian Splatting with explicit object meshes suitable for physics simulation within a single representation. We propose an end-to-end optimization pipeline that leverages differentiable rendering and differentiable physics within MuJoCo to jointly refine all scene components - from object geometry and appearance to robot poses and physical parameters - directly from raw and imprecise robot trajectories. This unified optimization allows us to simultaneously achieve high-fidelity object mesh reconstruction, generate photorealistic novel views, and perform annotation-free robot pose calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach both in simulation and on challenging real-world sequences using an ALOHA 2 bi-manual manipulator, enabling more practical and robust real-to-simulation pipelines.",

However, existing methods face scalability limitations (requiring 3D supervision or costly annotations), robustness issues (being susceptible to local optima), and rendering shortcomings (lacking speed or photorealism). We introduce SplArt, a self-supervised, category-agnostic framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to reconstruct articulated objects and infer kinematics from two sets of posed RGB images captured at different articulation states, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering for novel viewpoints and articulations. SplArt augments 3DGS with a differentiable mobility parameter per Gaussian, achieving refined part segmentation. A multi-stage optimization strategy is employed to progressively handle reconstruction, part segmentation, and articulation estimation, significantly enhancing robustness and accuracy. SplArt exploits geometric self-supervision, effectively addressing challenging scenarios without requiring 3D annotations or category-specific priors. Evaluations on established and newly proposed benchmarks, along with applications to real-world scenarios using a handheld RGB camera, demonstrate SplArt's state-of-the-art performance and real-world practicality.

    "abstract": "3D reconstruction from in-the-wild images remains a challenging task due to inconsistent lighting conditions and transient distractors. Existing methods typically rely on heuristic strategies to handle the low-quality training data, which often struggle to produce stable and consistent reconstructions, frequently resulting in visual artifacts. In this work, we propose \\modelname{}, a novel framework that leverages the stochastic nature of these artifacts: they tend to vary across different training runs due to minor randomness. Specifically, our method trains two 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models in parallel, enforcing a consistency constraint that encourages convergence on reliable scene geometry while suppressing inconsistent artifacts. To prevent the two models from collapsing into similar failure modes due to confirmation bias, we introduce a divergent masking strategy that applies two complementary masks: a multi-cue adaptive mask and a self-supervised soft mask, which leads to an asymmetric training process of the two models, reducing shared error modes. In addition, to improve the efficiency of model training, we introduce a lightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy, which replaces one of the two models with a dynamically updated Exponential Moving Average (EMA) proxy, and employs an alternating masking strategy to preserve divergence. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches while achieving high efficiency.

In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra, including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.   Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.   Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).",

    "abstract": "Computer System Architecture serves as a crucial bridge between software applications and the underlying hardware, encompassing components like compilers, CPUs, coprocessors, and RTL designs. Its development, from early mainframes to modern domain-specific architectures, has been driven by rising computational demands and advancements in semiconductor technology. However, traditional paradigms in computer system architecture design are confronting significant challenges, including a reliance on manual expertise, fragmented optimization across software and hardware layers, and high costs associated with exploring expansive design spaces. While automated methods leveraging optimization algorithms and machine learning have improved efficiency, they remain constrained by a single-stage focus, limited data availability, and a lack of comprehensive human domain knowledge. The emergence of large language models offers transformative opportunities for the design of computer system architecture. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in areas such as code generation, data analysis, and performance modeling, the traditional manual design process can be transitioned to a machine-based automated design approach. To harness this potential, we present the Large Processor Chip Model (LPCM), an LLM-driven framework aimed at achieving end-to-end automated computer architecture design. The LPCM is structured into three levels: Human-Centric; Agent-Orchestrated; and Model-Governed. This paper utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting as a representative workload and employs the concept of software-hardware collaborative design to examine the implementation of the LPCM at Level 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, this paper provides an in-depth discussion on the pathway to implementing Level 2 and Level 3 of the LPCM, along with an analysis of the existing challenges.",

However, rendering city-scale 3DGS scenes on resource-constrained mobile devices in real-time remains a significant challenge due to two compute-intensive stages: level-of-detail (LoD) search and rasterization.   In this paper, we propose Voyager, an effective solution to accelerate city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Our key insight is that, under normal user motion, the number of newly visible Gaussians within the view frustum remains roughly constant. Leveraging this temporal correlation, we propose a temporal-aware LoD search to identify the necessary Gaussians for the remaining rendering stages. For the remaining rendering process, we accelerate the bottleneck stage, rasterization, via preemptive $\\alpha$-filtering. With all optimizations above, our system can deliver low-latency, city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Compared to existing solutions, Voyager achieves up to 6.6$\\times$ speedup and 85\\% energy savings with superior rendering quality.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its real-time, photo-realistic rendering in novel-view synthesis and 3D modeling. However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling scenes affected by transient objects, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances. To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method.

However, developing and evaluating 3DGS-enabled applications and optimizing their rendering performance, require realistic user navigation data. Such data is currently unavailable for photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world scenes. This paper introduces EyeNavGS (EyeNavGS), the first publicly available 6-DoF navigation dataset featuring traces from 46 participants exploring twelve diverse, real-world 3DGS scenes. The dataset was collected at two sites, using the Meta Quest Pro headsets, recording the head pose and eye gaze data for each rendered frame during free world standing 6-DoF navigation. For each of the twelve scenes, we performed careful scene initialization to correct for scene tilt and scale, ensuring a perceptually-comfortable VR experience. We also release our open-source SIBR viewer software fork with record-and-replay functionalities and a suite of utility tools for data processing, conversion, and visualization. The EyeNavGS dataset and its accompanying software tools provide valuable resources for advancing research in 6-DoF viewport prediction, adaptive streaming, 3D saliency, and foveated rendering for 3DGS scenes.

    "abstract": "Generating 3D worlds from text is a highly anticipated goal in computer vision. Existing works are limited by the degree of exploration they allow inside of a scene, i.e., produce streched-out and noisy artifacts when moving beyond central or panoramic perspectives. To this end, we propose WorldExplorer, a novel method based on autoregressive video trajectory generation, which builds fully navigable 3D scenes with consistent visual quality across a wide range of viewpoints. We initialize our scenes by creating multi-view consistent images corresponding to a 360 degree panorama. Then, we expand it by leveraging video diffusion models in an iterative scene generation pipeline. Concretely, we generate multiple videos along short, pre-defined trajectories, that explore the scene in depth, including motion around objects. Our novel scene memory conditions each video on the most relevant prior views, while a collision-detection mechanism prevents degenerate results, like moving into objects. Finally, we fuse all generated views into a unified 3D representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization. Compared to prior approaches, WorldExplorer produces high-quality scenes that remain stable under large camera motion, enabling for the first time realistic and unrestricted exploration. We believe this marks a significant step toward generating immersive and truly explorable virtual 3D environments.",

To address these limitations, we introduce WoMAP (World Models for Active Perception): a recipe for training open-vocabulary object localization policies that: (i) uses a Gaussian Splatting-based real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for scalable data generation without the need for expert demonstrations, (ii) distills dense rewards signals from open-vocabulary object detectors, and (iii) leverages a latent world model for dynamics and rewards prediction to ground high-level action proposals at inference time. Rigorous simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate WoMAP's superior performance in a broad range of zero-shot object localization tasks, with more than 9x and 2x higher success rates compared to VLM and diffusion policy baselines, respectively. Further, we show that WoMAP achieves strong generalization and sim-to-real transfer on a TidyBot.",

    "abstract": "High-Fidelity 3D scene reconstruction plays a crucial role in autonomous driving by enabling novel data generation from existing datasets. This allows simulating safety-critical scenarios and augmenting training datasets without incurring further data collection costs. While recent advances in radiance fields have demonstrated promising results in 3D reconstruction and sensor data synthesis using cameras and LiDAR, their potential for radar remains largely unexplored. Radar is crucial for autonomous driving due to its robustness in adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow, where optical sensors often struggle. Although the state-of-the-art radar-based neural representation shows promise for 3D driving scene reconstruction, it performs poorly in scenarios with significant radar noise, including receiver saturation and multipath reflection. Moreover, it is limited to synthesizing preprocessed, noise-excluded radar images, failing to address realistic radar data synthesis. To address these limitations, this paper proposes RadarSplat, which integrates Gaussian Splatting with novel radar noise modeling to enable realistic radar data synthesis and enhanced 3D reconstruction. Compared to the state-of-the-art, RadarSplat achieves superior radar image synthesis (+3.4 PSNR / 2.6x SSIM) and improved geometric reconstruction (-40% RMSE / 1.5x Accuracy), demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-fidelity radar data and scene reconstruction.

    "abstract": "Accurate 3D fruit counting in orchards is challenging due to heavy occlusion, semantic ambiguity between fruits and surrounding structures, and the high computational cost of volumetric reconstruction. Existing pipelines often rely on multi-view 2D segmentation and dense volumetric sampling, which lead to accumulated fusion errors and slow inference. We introduce FruitLangGS, a language-guided 3D fruit counting framework that reconstructs orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive-density Gaussian Splatting pipeline with radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization, enabling scalable 3D representation. During inference, compressed CLIP-aligned semantic vectors embedded in each Gaussian are filtered via a dual-threshold cosine similarity mechanism, retrieving Gaussians relevant to target prompts while suppressing common distractors (e.g., foliage), without requiring retraining or image-space masks. The selected Gaussians are then sampled into dense point clouds and clustered geometrically to estimate fruit instances, remaining robust under severe occlusion and viewpoint variation. Experiments on nine different orchard-scale datasets demonstrate that FruitLangGS consistently outperforms existing pipelines in instance counting recall, avoiding multi-view segmentation fusion errors and achieving up to 99.7% recall on Pfuji-Size_Orch2018 orchard dataset. Ablation studies further confirm that language-conditioned semantic embedding and dual-threshold prompt filtering are essential for suppressing distractors and improving counting accuracy under heavy occlusion. Beyond fruit counting, the same framework enables prompt-driven 3D semantic retrieval without retraining, highlighting the potential of language-guided 3D perception for scalable agricultural scene understanding.",

Contrary to existing 3DGS compression methods, our approach can produce compressed 3DGS models at multiple bitrates in a computationally efficient way. Point cloud voxelization is a discretization technique that point cloud codecs use to improve coding efficiency while enabling the use of fast transform coding algorithms. We propose an adaptive voxelization algorithm tailored to 3DGS data, to avoid the inefficiencies introduced by uniform voxelization used in point cloud codecs. We ensure the positions of larger volume Gaussians are represented at high resolution, as these significantly impact rendering quality. Meanwhile, a low-resolution representation is used for dense regions with smaller Gaussians, which have a relatively lower impact on rendering quality. This adaptive voxelization approach significantly reduces the number of Gaussians and the bitrate required to encode the 3DGS data. After voxelization, many Gaussians are moved or eliminated. Thus, we propose to fine-tune/recolor the remaining 3DGS attributes with an initialization that can reduce the amount of retraining required. Experimental results on pre-trained datasets show that our proposed compression framework outperforms existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) enable high-quality 3D scene reconstruction from RGB images. Many studies extend this paradigm for language-driven open-vocabulary scene understanding. However, most of them simply project 2D semantic features onto 3D Gaussians and overlook a fundamental gap between 2D and 3D understanding: a 3D object may exhibit various semantics from different viewpoints--a phenomenon we term view-dependent semantics. To address this challenge, we propose LaGa (Language Gaussians), which establishes cross-view semantic connections by decomposing the 3D scene into objects. Then, it constructs view-aggregated semantic representations by clustering semantic descriptors and reweighting them based on multi-view semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaGa effectively captures key information from view-dependent semantics, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of 3D scenes. Notably, under the same settings, LaGa achieves a significant improvement of +18.7% mIoU over the previous SOTA on the LERF-OVS dataset.

While diffusion-based methods effectively model continuous latent spaces and AR models excel at capturing inter-token dependencies, combining these paradigms for 3D shape generation remains a challenge. To address this, LTM3D features a Conditional Distribution Modeling backbone, leveraging a masked autoencoder and a diffusion model to enhance token dependency learning. Additionally, we introduce Prefix Learning, which aligns condition tokens with shape latent tokens during generation, improving flexibility across modalities. We further propose a Latent Token Reconstruction module with Reconstruction-Guided Sampling to reduce uncertainty and enhance structural fidelity in generated shapes. Our approach operates in token space, enabling support for multiple 3D representations, including signed distance fields, point clouds, meshes, and 3D Gaussian Splatting.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) marks a significant milestone in balancing the quality and efficiency of differentiable rendering. However, its high efficiency stems from an approximation of projecting 3D Gaussians onto the image plane as 2D Gaussians, which inherently limits rendering quality--particularly under large Field-of-View (FoV) camera inputs. While several recent works have extended 3DGS to mitigate these approximation errors, none have successfully achieved both exactness and high efficiency simultaneously. In this work, we introduce 3DGEER, an Exact and Efficient Volumetric Gaussian Rendering method. Starting from first principles, we derive a closed-form expression for the density integral along a ray traversing a 3D Gaussian distribution. This formulation enables precise forward rendering with arbitrary camera models and supports gradient-based optimization of 3D Gaussian parameters. To ensure both exactness and real-time performance, we propose an efficient method for computing a tight Particle Bounding Frustum (PBF) for each 3D Gaussian, enabling accurate and efficient ray-Gaussian association. We also introduce a novel Bipolar Equiangular Projection (BEAP) representation to accelerate ray association under generic camera models. BEAP further provides a more uniform ray sampling strategy to apply supervision, which empirically improves reconstruction quality. Experiments on multiple pinhole and fisheye datasets show that our method consistently outperforms prior methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in real-time neural rendering.",

However, their scalability is fundamentally constrained by the limited capacity of their encoders, leading to degraded performance or excessive memory consumption as the number of input views increases. In this work, we analyze feed-forward 3DGS frameworks through the lens of the Information Bottleneck principle and introduce ZPressor, a lightweight architecture-agnostic module that enables efficient compression of multi-view inputs into a compact latent state $Z$ that retains essential scene information while discarding redundancy. Concretely, ZPressor enables existing feed-forward 3DGS models to scale to over 100 input views at 480P resolution on an 80GB GPU, by partitioning the views into anchor and support sets and using cross attention to compress the information from the support views into anchor views, forming the compressed latent state $Z$. We show that integrating ZPressor into several state-of-the-art feed-forward 3DGS models consistently improves performance under moderate input views and enhances robustness under dense view settings on two large-scale benchmarks DL3DV-10K and RealEstate10K.

    "abstract": "Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and remains compatible with them. We propose a novel approach for policy mobilization that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to identify optimal robot poses. To understand policy mobilization in more depth, we also introduce the Mobi-$\\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, and (3) visualization tools for analysis. In both our developed simulation task suite and the real world, we show that our approach outperforms baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for policy mobilization.",

Triangles, unlike full-rank Gaussian kernels, naturally combine to form surfaces. We formulate connectivity forces between triangles during optimization, encouraging explicit, but soft, surface continuity in 3D.

To address these limitations, we propose MixGS, a novel holistic optimization framework for large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. MixGS models the entire scene holistically by integrating camera pose and Gaussian attributes into a view-aware representation, which is decoded into fine-detailed Gaussians. Furthermore, a novel mixing operation combines decoded and original Gaussians to jointly preserve global coherence and local fidelity. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes demonstrate that MixGS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and competitive speed, while significantly reducing computational requirements, enabling large-scale scene reconstruction training on a single 24GB VRAM GPU.

We construct each LOD level by applying a depth-aware 3D smoothing filter, followed by importance-based pruning and fine-tuning to maintain visual fidelity. To further reduce memory overhead, we partition the scene into spatial chunks and dynamically load only relevant Gaussians during rendering, employing an opacity-blending mechanism to avoid visual artifacts at chunk boundaries.

In real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate poses is challenging, leading to noisy pose estimates and geometric misalignments. To address this, we introduce SHARE, a pose-free, feed-forward Gaussian splatting framework that overcomes these ambiguities by joint shape and camera rays estimation. Instead of relying on explicit 3D transformations, SHARE builds a pose-aware canonical volume representation that seamlessly integrates multi-view information, reducing misalignment caused by inaccurate pose estimates. Additionally, anchor-aligned Gaussian prediction enhances scene reconstruction by refining local geometry around coarse anchors, allowing for more precise Gaussian placement.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its fast and high-quality rendering, but it has a very large memory footprint incurring high transmission and storage overhead. Recently, some neural compression methods, such as Scaffold-GS, were proposed for 3DGS but they did not adopt the approach of end-to-end optimized analysis-synthesis transforms which has been proven highly effective in neural signal compression. Without an appropriate analysis transform, signal correlations cannot be removed by sparse representation. Without such transforms the only way to remove signal redundancies is through entropy coding driven by a complex and expensive context modeling, which results in slower speed and suboptimal rate-distortion (R-D) performance. To overcome this weakness, we propose Sparsity-guided Hierarchical Transform Coding (SHTC), the first end-to-end optimized transform coding framework for 3DGS compression. SHTC jointly optimizes the 3DGS, transforms and a lightweight context model. This joint optimization enables the transform to produce representations that approach the best R-D performance possible. The SHTC framework consists of a base layer using KLT for data decorrelation, and a sparsity-coded enhancement layer that compresses the KLT residuals to refine the representation. The enhancement encoder learns a linear transform to project high-dimensional inputs into a low-dimensional space, while the decoder unfolds the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) to reconstruct the residuals. All components are designed to be interpretable, allowing the incorporation of signal priors and fewer parameters than black-box transforms. This novel design significantly improves R-D performance with minimal additional parameters and computational overhead.",

However, their sequential optimization framework and sensitivity to dynamic objects limit real-time performance and robustness in real-world scenarios. We present UP-SLAM, a real-time RGB-D SLAM system for dynamic environments that decouples tracking and mapping through a parallelized framework. A probabilistic octree is employed to manage Gaussian primitives adaptively, enabling efficient initialization and pruning without hand-crafted thresholds. To robustly filter dynamic regions during tracking, we propose a training-free uncertainty estimator that fuses multi-modal residuals to estimate per-pixel motion uncertainty, achieving open-set dynamic object handling without reliance on semantic labels. Furthermore, a temporal encoder is designed to enhance rendering quality. Concurrently, low-dimensional features are efficiently transformed via a shallow multilayer perceptron to construct DINO features, which are then employed to enrich the Gaussian field and improve the robustness of uncertainty prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets suggest that UP-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both localization accuracy (by 59.8%) and rendering quality (by 4.57 dB PSNR), while maintaining real-time performance and producing reusable, artifact-free static maps in dynamic environments.The project: https://aczheng-cai.github.io/up_slam.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision that aims to reconstruct realistic images from a set of posed input views. However, reconstruction quality degrades significantly under sparse-view conditions due to limited geometric cues. Existing methods, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and the more recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), often suffer from blurred details and structural artifacts when trained with insufficient views. Recent works have identified the quality of rendered depth as a key factor in mitigating these artifacts, as it directly affects geometric accuracy and view consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Hierarchical Depth-Guided Splatting (HDGS), a depth supervision framework that progressively refines geometry from coarse to fine levels. Central to HDGS is a novel Cascade Pearson Correlation Loss (CPCL), which aligns rendered and estimated monocular depths across multiple spatial scales. By enforcing multi-scale depth consistency, our method substantially improves structural fidelity in sparse-view scenarios. Extensive experiments on the LLFF and DTU benchmarks demonstrate that HDGS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse-view settings while maintaining efficient and high-quality rendering",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has been widely used in agricultural applications for non-destructive estimation of plant nutrient composition and precise determination of nutritional elements in samples. Recently, 3D reconstruction methods have been used to create implicit neural representations of HSI scenes, which can help localize the target object's nutrient composition spatially and spectrally. Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a cutting-edge implicit representation that can render hyperspectral channel compositions of each spatial location from any viewing direction. However, it faces limitations in training time and rendering speed. In this paper, we propose Hyperspectral Gaussian Splatting (HS-GS), which combines the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with a diffusion model to enable 3D explicit reconstruction of the hyperspectral scenes and novel view synthesis for the entire spectral range. To enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained reflectance variations across the light spectrum and leverage correlations between adjacent wavelengths for denoising, we introduce a wavelength encoder to generate wavelength-specific spherical harmonics offsets. We also introduce a novel Kullback--Leibler divergence-based loss to mitigate the spectral distribution gap between the rendered image and the ground truth. A diffusion model is further applied for denoising the rendered images and generating photorealistic hyperspectral images. We present extensive evaluations on five diverse hyperspectral scenes from the Hyper-NeRF dataset to show the effectiveness of our proposed HS-GS framework. The results demonstrate that HS-GS achieves new state-of-the-art performance among all previously published methods. Code will be released upon publication.",

However, this capability is limited to estimating the visible external structure, and identifying the invisible internal structure hidden behind the surface is difficult. To overcome this limitation, we address a new task called Structure from Collision (SfC), which aims to estimate the structure (including the invisible internal structure) of an object from appearance changes during collision. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model called SfC-NeRF that optimizes the invisible internal structure of an object through a video sequence under physical, appearance (i.e., visible external structure)-preserving, and keyframe constraints. In particular, to avoid falling into undesirable local optima owing to its ill-posed nature, we propose volume annealing; that is, searching for global optima by repeatedly reducing and expanding the volume. Extensive experiments on 115 objects involving diverse structures (i.e., various cavity shapes, locations, and sizes) and material properties revealed the properties of SfC and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SfC-NeRF.",

Optical scattering and absorption in water body bring inhomogeneous medium attenuation interference that disrupts conventional volume rendering assumptions of uniform propagation medium. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers real-time rendering capabilities, it struggles with underwater inhomogeneous environments where scattering media introduce artifacts and inconsistent appearance. In this study, we propose a physics-based framework that disentangles object appearance from water medium effects through tailored Gaussian modeling. Our approach introduces appearance embeddings, which are explicit medium representations for backscatter and attenuation, enhancing scene consistency. In addition, we propose a distance-guided optimization strategy that leverages pseudo-depth maps as supervision with depth regularization and scale penalty terms to improve geometric fidelity. By integrating the proposed appearance and medium modeling components via an underwater imaging model, our approach achieves both high-quality novel view synthesis and physically accurate scene restoration.

While aerial imagery offers broad coverage and complements limitations of ground-based data, reconstructing city-scale environments from such views remains challenging due to occlusions, incomplete geometry, and high memory demands. Recent advances like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) improve scalability and visual quality but remain limited by dense primitive usage, long training times, and poor suit ability for edge devices. We propose CityGo, a hybrid framework that combines textured proxy geometry with residual and surrounding 3D Gaussians for lightweight, photorealistic rendering of urban scenes from aerial perspectives. Our approach first extracts compact building proxy meshes from MVS point clouds, then uses zero order SH Gaussians to generate occlusion-free textures via image-based rendering and back-projection. To capture high-frequency details, we introduce residual Gaussians placed based on proxy-photo discrepancies and guided by depth priors. Broader urban context is represented by surrounding Gaussians, with importance-aware downsampling applied to non-critical regions to reduce redundancy. A tailored optimization strategy jointly refines proxy textures and Gaussian parameters, enabling real-time rendering of complex urban scenes on mobile GPUs with significantly reduced training and memory requirements. Extensive experiments on real-world aerial datasets demonstrate that our hybrid representation significantly reduces training time, achieving on average 1.4x speedup, while delivering comparable visual fidelity to pure 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches. Furthermore, CityGo enables real-time rendering of large-scale urban scenes on mobile consumer GPUs, with substantially reduced memory usage and energy consumption.",

Specifically, Intern-GS utilizes vision foundation models to guide both the initialization and the optimization process of 3D Gaussian splatting, effectively addressing the limitations of sparse inputs.

This approach significantly alleviates the limitations encountered by traditional structure-from-motion (SfM) methods, which often struggle under sparse-view constraints. During the optimization process, vision foundation models predict depth and appearance for unobserved views, refining the 3D Gaussians to compensate for missing information in unseen regions.

Grounded in fundamental physics, we uncover the complex relationship between EM wave propagation behaviors and RF frequencies. Inspired by this, we design an EM feature network with attenuation and radiance modules to learn the complex relationships between RF frequencies and the key properties of each 3D Gaussian, specifically the attenuation factor and RF signal intensity. By training the frequency-embedded 3DGS model, we can efficiently reconstruct RF radiance fields at arbitrary unknown frequencies within a given 3D environment. Finally, we propose a large-scale power angular spectrum (PAS) dataset containing 50000 samples ranging from 1 to 100 GHz in 6 indoor environments, and conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method. Our approach achieves an average Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) up to 0.72, and a significant improvement up to 17.8% compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods trained on individual test frequencies. Additionally, our method achieves an SSIM of 0.70 without prior training on these frequencies, which represents only a 2.8% performance drop compared to models trained with full PAS data.

The core advantage of our method lies in its ability to learn differential equations that describe the dynamics of 3D Gaussians, and follow them during future frame extrapolation. Instead of simply fitting to the observed visual frame sequence, we aim to more effectively model the gaussian particle dynamics system. To this end, we introduce a dynamics latent state vector into the standard Gaussian kernel and design a dynamics latent space encoder to extract initial state. Subsequently, we introduce a Neural ODEs-based dynamics module that models the temporal evolution of Gaussian in dynamics latent space. Finally, a Gaussian kernel space decoder is used to decode latent state at the specific time step into the deformation.

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting (GS) has gained attention as a fast and effective method for novel view synthesis. It has also been applied to 3D reconstruction using multi-view images and can achieve fast and accurate 3D reconstruction. However, GS assumes that the input contains a large number of multi-view images, and therefore, the reconstruction accuracy significantly decreases when only a limited number of input images are available. One of the main reasons is the insufficient number of 3D points in the sparse point cloud obtained through Structure from Motion (SfM), which results in a poor initialization for optimizing the Gaussian primitives. We propose a new 3D reconstruction method, called Sparse2DGS, to enhance 2DGS in reconstructing objects using only three images. Sparse2DGS employs DUSt3R, a fundamental model for stereo images, along with COLMAP MVS to generate highly accurate and dense 3D point clouds, which are then used to initialize 2D Gaussians. Through experiments on the DTU dataset, we show that Sparse2DGS can accurately reconstruct the 3D shapes of objects using just three images.

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis in 360$^\\circ$ scenes from extremely sparse input views is essential for applications like virtual reality and augmented reality. This paper presents a novel framework for novel view synthesis in extremely sparse-view cases. As typical structure-from-motion methods are unable to estimate camera poses in extremely sparse-view cases, we apply DUSt3R to estimate camera poses and generate a dense point cloud. Using the poses of estimated cameras, we densely sample additional views from the upper hemisphere space of the scenes, from which we render synthetic images together with the point cloud. Training 3D Gaussian Splatting model on a combination of reference images from sparse views and densely sampled synthetic images allows a larger scene coverage in 3D space, addressing the overfitting challenge due to the limited input in sparse-view cases. Retraining a diffusion-based image enhancement model on our created dataset, we further improve the quality of the point-cloud-rendered images by removing artifacts. We compare our framework with benchmark methods in cases of only four input views, demonstrating significant improvement in novel view synthesis under extremely sparse-view conditions for 360$^\\circ$ scenes.",

    "abstract": "The field of computer graphics was revolutionized by models such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, displacing triangles as the dominant representation for photogrammetry. In this paper, we argue for a triangle comeback. We develop a differentiable renderer that directly optimizes triangles via end-to-end gradients. We achieve this by rendering each triangle as differentiable splats, combining the efficiency of triangles with the adaptive density of representations based on independent primitives. Compared to popular 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, our approach achieves higher visual fidelity, faster convergence, and increased rendering throughput. On the Mip-NeRF360 dataset, our method outperforms concurrent non-volumetric primitives in visual fidelity and achieves higher perceptual quality than the state-of-the-art Zip-NeRF on indoor scenes. Triangles are simple, compatible with standard graphics stacks and GPU hardware, and highly efficient: for the \\textit{Garden} scene, we achieve over 2,400 FPS at 1280x720 resolution using an off-the-shelf mesh renderer. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of triangle-based representations for high-quality novel view synthesis. Triangles bring us closer to mesh-based optimization by combining classical computer graphics with modern differentiable rendering frameworks.

    "abstract": "Scene understanding based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently achieved notable advances. Although 3DGS related methods have efficient rendering capabilities, they fail to address the inherent contradiction between the anisotropic color representation of gaussian primitives and the isotropic requirements of semantic features, leading to insufficient cross-view feature consistency. To overcome the limitation, we proposes $\\textit{FHGS}$ (Feature-Homogenized Gaussian Splatting), a novel 3D feature fusion framework inspired by physical models, which can achieve high-precision mapping of arbitrary 2D features from pre-trained models to 3D scenes while preserving the real-time rendering efficiency of 3DGS. Specifically, our $\\textit{FHGS}$ introduces the following innovations: Firstly, a universal feature fusion architecture is proposed, enabling robust embedding of large-scale pre-trained models' semantic features (e.g., SAM, CLIP) into sparse 3D structures. Secondly, a non-differentiable feature fusion mechanism is introduced, which enables semantic features to exhibit viewpoint independent isotropic distributions. This fundamentally balances the anisotropic rendering of gaussian primitives and the isotropic expression of features; Thirdly, a dual-driven optimization strategy inspired by electric potential fields is proposed, which combines external supervision from semantic feature fields with internal primitive clustering guidance. This mechanism enables synergistic optimization of global semantic alignment and local structural consistency. More interactive results can be accessed on: https://fhgs.cuastro.org/.",

    "abstract": "Recent works demonstrate the advantages of hardware rasterization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in forward-pass rendering through fast GPU-optimized graphics and fixed memory footprint. However, extending these benefits to backward-pass gradient computation remains challenging due to graphics pipeline constraints. We present a differentiable hardware rasterizer for 3DGS that overcomes the memory and performance limitations of tile-based software rasterization. Our solution employs programmable blending for per-pixel gradient computation combined with a hybrid gradient reduction strategy (quad-level + subgroup) in fragment shaders, achieving over 10x faster backward rasterization versus naive atomic operations and 3x speedup over the canonical tile-based rasterizer. Systematic evaluation reveals 16-bit render targets (float16 and unorm16) as the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off, achieving higher gradient accuracy among mixed-precision rendering formats with execution speeds second only to unorm8, while float32 texture incurs severe forward pass performance degradation due to suboptimal hardware optimizations. Our method with float16 formats demonstrates 3.07x acceleration in full pipeline execution (forward + backward passes) on RTX4080 GPUs with the MipNeRF 360 dataset, outperforming the baseline tile-based renderer while preserving hardware rasterization's memory efficiency advantages -- incurring merely 2.67% of the memory overhead required for splat sorting operations. This work presents a unified differentiable hardware rasterization method that simultaneously optimizes runtime and memory usage for 3DGS, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained devices with limited memory capacity.",

To address this issue, we propose SuperGS, an expansion of Scaffold-GS designed with a two-stage coarse-to-fine training framework. In the low-resolution stage, we introduce a latent feature field to represent the low-resolution scene, which serves as both the initialization and foundational information for super-resolution optimization. In the high-resolution stage, we propose a multi-view consistent densification strategy that backprojects high-resolution depth maps based on error maps and employs a multi-view voting mechanism, mitigating ambiguities caused by multi-view inconsistencies in the pseudo labels provided by 2D prior models while avoiding Gaussian redundancy. Furthermore, we model uncertainty through variational feature learning and use it to guide further scene representation refinement and adjust the supervisory effect of pseudo-labels, ensuring consistent and detailed scene reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGS outperforms state-of-the-art HRNVS methods on both forward-facing and 360-degree datasets.",

Current 3D pose estimation techniques, such as keypoint- and mesh-based techniques, often face challenges including limited representational detail, labor-intensive annotation requirements, and expensive per-frame optimization. These limitations hinder the study of subtle movements and can make large-scale analyses impractical. We propose Pose Splatter, a novel framework leveraging shape carving and 3D Gaussian splatting to model the complete pose and appearance of laboratory animals without prior knowledge of animal geometry, per-frame optimization, or manual annotations. We also propose a novel rotation-invariant visual embedding technique for encoding pose and appearance, designed to be a plug-in replacement for 3D keypoint data in downstream behavioral analyses. Experiments on datasets of mice, rats, and zebra finches show Pose Splatter learns accurate 3D animal geometries. Notably, Pose Splatter represents subtle variations in pose, provides better low-dimensional pose embeddings over state-of-the-art as evaluated by humans, and generalizes to unseen data. By eliminating annotation and per-frame optimization bottlenecks, Pose Splatter enables analysis of large-scale, longitudinal behavior needed to map genotype, neural activity, and micro-behavior at unprecedented resolution.",

Then, instead of directly predicting the time-dependent signals, we model the signal as the sum of video-constant values, segment-constant values, and frame-specific residuals, as inspired by the success of residual learning. This approach allows more flexible models that adapt to highly variable scenes.

SplatCo builds upon two novel components: (1) a cross-structure collaboration module that combines global tri-plane representations, which capture coarse scene layouts, with local context grid features that represent fine surface details. This fusion is achieved through a novel hierarchical compensation strategy, ensuring both global consistency and local detail preservation; and (2) a cross-view assisted training strategy that enhances multi-view consistency by synchronizing gradient updates across viewpoints, applying visibility-aware densification, and pruning overfitted or inaccurate Gaussians based on structural consistency. Through joint optimization of structural representation and multi-view coherence, SplatCo effectively reconstructs fine-grained geometric structures and complex textures in large-scale scenes. Comprehensive evaluations on 13 diverse large-scale scenes, including Mill19, MatrixCity, Tanks & Temples, WHU, and custom aerial captures, demonstrate that SplatCo consistently achieves higher reconstruction quality than state-of-the-art methods, with PSNR improvements of 1-2 dB and SSIM gains of 0.1 to 0.2.

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D GANs based on 3D Gaussian splatting have been proposed for high quality synthesis of human heads. However, existing methods stabilize training and enhance rendering quality from steep viewpoints by conditioning the random latent vector on the current camera position. This compromises 3D consistency, as we observe significant identity changes when re-synthesizing the 3D head with each camera shift. Conversely, fixing the camera to a single viewpoint yields high-quality renderings for that perspective but results in poor performance for novel views. Removing view-conditioning typically destabilizes GAN training, often causing the training to collapse. In response to these challenges, we introduce CGS-GAN, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting GAN framework that enables stable training and high-quality 3D-consistent synthesis of human heads without relying on view-conditioning. To ensure training stability, we introduce a multi-view regularization technique that enhances generator convergence with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, we adapt the conditional loss used in existing 3D Gaussian splatting GANs and propose a generator architecture designed to not only stabilize training but also facilitate efficient rendering and straightforward scaling, enabling output resolutions up to $2048^2$. To evaluate the capabilities of CGS-GAN, we curate a new dataset derived from FFHQ. This dataset enables very high resolutions, focuses on larger portions of the human head, reduces view-dependent artifacts for improved 3D consistency, and excludes images where subjects are obscured by hands or other objects. As a result, our approach achieves very high rendering quality, supported by competitive FID scores, while ensuring consistent 3D scene generation.

In this work, we present a UAV-based pipeline that extends Feature-3DGS for language-guided 3D segmentation. We leverage LSeg-based feature fields with CLIP embeddings to generate heatmaps in response to language prompts. These are thresholded to produce rough segmentations, and the highest-scoring point is then used as a prompt to SAM or SAM2 for refined 2D segmentation on novel view renderings. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of various feature field backbones (CLIP-LSeg, SAM, SAM2) in capturing meaningful structure in large-scale outdoor environments. We demonstrate that this hybrid approach enables flexible, language-driven interaction with photorealistic 3D reconstructions, opening new possibilities for semantic aerial inspection and scene understanding.",

Current high-fidelity approaches, especially neural rendering techniques, require time-consuming per-scene optimization, limiting clinical applicability due to computational demands and poor generalizability.

Render-FM employs an encoder-decoder architecture that directly regresses 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS) parameters from CT volumes, eliminating per-scan optimization through large-scale pre-training on diverse medical data. By integrating robust feature extraction with the expressive power of 6DGS, our approach efficiently generates high-quality, real-time interactive 3D visualizations across diverse clinical CT data. Experiments demonstrate that Render-FM achieves visual fidelity comparable or superior to specialized per-scan methods while drastically reducing preparation time from nearly an hour to seconds for a single inference step.

    "abstract": "We present a novel framework for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction that integrates three key components: an explicit tri-plane deformation field, a view-conditioned canonical radiance field with spherical harmonics (SH) attention, and a temporally-aware latent diffusion prior. Our method encodes 4D scenes using three orthogonal 2D feature planes that evolve over time, enabling efficient and compact spatiotemporal representation. These features are explicitly warped into a canonical space via a deformation offset field, eliminating the need for MLP-based motion modeling.   In canonical space, we replace traditional MLP decoders with a structured SH-based rendering head that synthesizes view-dependent color via attention over learned frequency bands improving both interpretability and rendering efficiency. To further enhance fidelity and temporal consistency, we introduce a transformer-guided latent diffusion module that refines the tri-plane and deformation features in a compressed latent space. This generative module denoises scene representations under ambiguous or out-of-distribution (OOD) motion, improving generalization.   Our model is trained in two stages: the diffusion module is first pre-trained independently, and then fine-tuned jointly with the full pipeline using a combination of image reconstruction, diffusion denoising, and temporal consistency losses. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on synthetic benchmarks, surpassing recent methods such as HexPlane and 4D Gaussian Splatting in visual quality, temporal coherence, and robustness to sparse-view dynamic inputs.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a high-fidelity and efficient paradigm for online free-viewpoint video (FVV) reconstruction, offering viewers rapid responsiveness and immersive experiences. However, existing online methods face challenge in prohibitive storage requirements primarily due to point-wise modeling that fails to exploit the motion properties. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Compact Gaussian Streaming (ComGS) framework, leveraging the locality and consistency of motion in dynamic scene, that models object-consistent Gaussian point motion through keypoint-driven motion representation. By transmitting only the keypoint attributes, this framework provides a more storage-efficient solution. Specifically, we first identify a sparse set of motion-sensitive keypoints localized within motion regions using a viewspace gradient difference strategy. Equipped with these keypoints, we propose an adaptive motion-driven mechanism that predicts a spatial influence field for propagating keypoint motion to neighboring Gaussian points with similar motion. Moreover, ComGS adopts an error-aware correction strategy for key frame reconstruction that selectively refines erroneous regions and mitigates error accumulation without unnecessary overhead. Overall, ComGS achieves a remarkable storage reduction of over 159 X compared to 3DGStream and 14 X compared to the SOTA method QUEEN, while maintaining competitive visual fidelity and rendering speed.

However, generating complex 3D objects, such as plants, remains a considerable challenge.

We introduce PlantDreamer, a novel approach to 3D synthetic plant generation, which can achieve greater levels of realism for complex plant geometry and textures than available text-to-3D models. To achieve this, our new generation pipeline leverages a depth ControlNet, fine-tuned Low-Rank Adaptation and an adaptable Gaussian culling algorithm, which directly improve textural realism and geometric integrity of generated 3D plant models. Additionally, PlantDreamer enables both purely synthetic plant generation, by leveraging L-System-generated meshes, and the enhancement of real-world plant point clouds by converting them into 3D Gaussian Splats. We evaluate our approach by comparing its outputs with state-of-the-art text-to-3D models, demonstrating that PlantDreamer outperforms existing methods in producing high-fidelity synthetic plants. Our results indicate that our approach not only advances synthetic plant generation, but also facilitates the upgrading of legacy point cloud datasets, making it a valuable tool for 3D phenotyping applications.",

Despite these advantages, 3DGS as a display-oriented representation requires substantial storage due to its numerous Gaussian attributes. Current compression methods have shown promising results but typically neglect the compression of Gaussian spatial positions, creating unnecessary bitstream overhead. We conceptualize Gaussian primitives as point clouds and propose leveraging point cloud compression techniques for more effective storage. AI-based point cloud compression demonstrates superior performance and faster inference compared to MPEG Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC).

To address these challenges, we introduce GausPcgc for Gaussian point cloud geometry compression along with a specialized training dataset GausPcc-1K. Our work pioneers the integration of AI-based point cloud compression into Gaussian compression pipelines, achieving superior compression ratios. The framework complements existing Gaussian compression methods while delivering significant performance improvements.

Therefore, in this paper, we present Consistent Personalization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (CP-GS), a framework that progressively propagates the single-view reference appearance to novel perspectives.

To tackle this, we introduce MGStream which employs the motion-related 3D Gaussians (3DGs) to reconstruct the dynamic and the vanilla 3DGs for the static. The motion-related 3DGs are implemented according to the motion mask and the clustering-based convex hull algorithm. The rigid deformation is applied to the motion-related 3DGs for modeling the dynamic, and the attention-based optimization on the motion-related 3DGs enables the reconstruction of the emerging objects.

    "abstract": "Currently almost all state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and reconstruction models rely on calibrated cameras or additional geometric priors for training. These prerequisites significantly limit their applicability to massive uncalibrated data. To alleviate this requirement and unlock the potential for self-supervised training on large-scale uncalibrated videos, we propose a novel two-stage strategy to train a view synthesis model from only raw video frames or multi-view images, without providing camera parameters or other priors. In the first stage, we learn to reconstruct the scene implicitly in a latent space without relying on any explicit 3D representation. Specifically, we predict per-frame latent camera and scene context features, and employ a view synthesis model as a proxy for explicit rendering. This pretraining stage substantially reduces the optimization complexity and encourages the network to learn the underlying 3D consistency in a self-supervised manner. The learned latent camera and implicit scene representation have a large gap compared with the real 3D world. To reduce this gap, we introduce the second stage training by explicitly predicting 3D Gaussian primitives. We additionally apply explicit Gaussian Splatting rendering loss and depth projection loss to align the learned latent representations with physically grounded 3D geometry. In this way, Stage 1 provides a strong initialization and Stage 2 enforces 3D consistency - the two stages are complementary and mutually beneficial. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high-quality novel view synthesis and accurate camera pose estimation, compared to methods that employ supervision with calibration, pose, or depth information.

However, existing methods suffer from substantial computational and memory overhead due to the redundant allocation of 4D Gaussians to static regions, which can also degrade image quality. In this work, we introduce hybrid 3D-4D Gaussian Splatting (3D-4DGS), a novel framework that adaptively represents static regions with 3D Gaussians while reserving 4D Gaussians for dynamic elements. Our method begins with a fully 4D Gaussian representation and iteratively converts temporally invariant Gaussians into 3D, significantly reducing the number of parameters and improving computational efficiency. Meanwhile, dynamic Gaussians retain their full 4D representation, capturing complex motions with high fidelity. Our approach achieves significantly faster training times compared to baseline 4D Gaussian Splatting methods while maintaining or improving the visual quality.",

    "abstract": "Compared to light-field microscopy (LFM), which enables high-speed volumetric imaging but suffers from non-uniform spatial sampling, Fourier light-field microscopy (FLFM) introduces sub-aperture division at the pupil plane, thereby ensuring spatially invariant sampling and enhancing spatial resolution. Conventional FLFM reconstruction methods, such as Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution, exhibit poor axial resolution and signal degradation due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. While data-driven approaches enhance spatial resolution by leveraging high-quality paired datasets or imposing structural priors, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods employ physics-informed self-supervised learning to overcome these limitations, yet they are hindered by substantial computational costs and memory demands. Therefore, we propose 3D Gaussian Adaptive Tomography (3DGAT) for FLFM, a 3D gaussian splatting based self-supervised learning framework that significantly improves the volumetric reconstruction quality of FLFM while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves higher resolution and improved reconstruction accuracy, highlighting its potential to advance FLFM imaging and broaden its applications in 3D optical microscopy.",

    "abstract": "The performance of multi-modal 3D occupancy prediction is limited by ineffective fusion, mainly due to geometry-semantics mismatch from fixed fusion strategies and surface detail loss caused by sparse, noisy annotations. The mismatch stems from the heterogeneous scale and distribution of point cloud and image features, leading to biased matching under fixed neighborhood fusion. To address this, we propose a target-scale adaptive, bidirectional symmetric retrieval mechanism. It expands the neighborhood for large targets to enhance context awareness and shrinks it for small ones to improve efficiency and suppress noise, enabling accurate cross-modal feature alignment. This mechanism explicitly establishes spatial correspondences and improves fusion accuracy. For surface detail loss, sparse labels provide limited supervision, resulting in poor predictions for small objects. We introduce an improved volume rendering pipeline based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which takes fused features as input to render images, applies photometric consistency supervision, and jointly optimizes 2D-3D consistency. This enhances surface detail reconstruction while suppressing noise propagation. In summary, we propose TACOcc, an adaptive multi-modal fusion framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction, enhanced by volume rendering supervision. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks validate its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "In embedded systems, robots must perceive and interpret their environment efficiently to operate reliably in real-world conditions. Visual Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) enhances standard SLAM by incorporating semantic information into the map, enabling more informed decision-making. However, implementing such systems on resource-limited hardware involves trade-offs between accuracy, computing efficiency, and power usage.   This paper provides a comparative review of recent Semantic Visual SLAM methods with a focus on their applicability to embedded platforms. We analyze three main types of architectures - Geometric SLAM, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and 3D Gaussian Splatting - and evaluate their performance on constrained hardware, specifically the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. We compare their accuracy, segmentation quality, memory usage, and energy consumption.   Our results show that methods based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting achieve high semantic detail but demand substantial computing resources, limiting their use on embedded devices. In contrast, Semantic Geometric SLAM offers a more practical balance between computational cost and accuracy. The review highlights a need for SLAM algorithms that are better adapted to embedded environments, and it discusses key directions for improving their efficiency through algorithm-hardware co-design.",

This framework can precisely parse motion parts and motion attributes only using a monocular video, completely eliminating the need for annotated training data. Specifically, our method first constructs the scene geometry and roughly analyzes the motion parts and their initial motion attributes combining depth estimation, optical flow analysis and point cloud registration method, then employs 2D Gaussian splatting for scene representation. Building on this, we introduce an end-to-end dynamic scene optimization algorithm specifically designed for articulated objects, refining the initial analysis results to ensure the system can handle 'rotation', 'translation', and even complex movements ('rotation+translation'), demonstrating high flexibility and versatility. To validate the robustness and wide applicability of our method, we created a comprehensive dataset comprising both simulated and real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that our framework can effectively analyze articulated object motions in an annotation-free manner, showcasing its significant potential in future embodied intelligence applications.",

    "abstract": "Vision based robot manipulation uses cameras to capture one or more images of a scene containing the objects to be manipulated. Taking multiple images can help if any object is occluded from one viewpoint but more visible from another viewpoint. However, the camera has to be moved to a sequence of suitable positions for capturing multiple images, which requires time and may not always be possible, due to reachability constraints. So while additional images can produce more accurate grasp poses due to the extra information available, the time-cost goes up with the number of additional views sampled. Scene representations like Gaussian Splatting are capable of rendering accurate photorealistic virtual images from user-specified novel viewpoints. In this work, we show initial results which indicate that novel view synthesis can provide additional context in generating grasp poses. Our experiments on the Graspnet-1billion dataset show that novel views contributed force-closure grasps in addition to the force-closure grasps obtained from sparsely sampled real views while also improving grasp coverage. In the future we hope this work can be extended to improve grasp extraction from radiance fields constructed with a single input image, using for example diffusion models or generalizable radiance fields.",

We present a novel framework for building temporal digital twins of plants by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with a robust sample alignment pipeline. Our method begins by reconstructing Gaussian Splats from multi-view camera data, then leverages a two-stage registration approach: coarse alignment through feature-based matching and Fast Global Registration, followed by fine alignment with Iterative Closest Point. This pipeline yields a consistent 4D model of plant development in discrete time steps.

    "abstract": "Efficient scene representations are essential for many real-world applications, especially those involving spatial measurement. Although current NeRF-based methods have achieved impressive results in reconstructing building-scale scenes, they still suffer from slow training and inference speeds due to time-consuming stochastic sampling. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated excellent performance with its high-quality rendering and real-time speed, especially for objects and small-scale scenes. However, in outdoor scenes, its point-based explicit representation lacks an effective adjustment mechanism, and the millions of Gaussian points required often lead to memory constraints during training. To address these challenges, we propose EA-3DGS, a high-quality real-time rendering method designed for outdoor scenes. First, we introduce a mesh structure to regulate the initialization of Gaussian components by leveraging an adaptive tetrahedral mesh that partitions the grid and initializes Gaussian components on each face, effectively capturing geometric structures in low-texture regions. Second, we propose an efficient Gaussian pruning strategy that evaluates each 3D Gaussian's contribution to the view and prunes accordingly. To retain geometry-critical Gaussian points, we also present a structure-aware densification strategy that densifies Gaussian points in low-curvature regions. Additionally, we employ vector quantization for parameter quantization of Gaussian components, significantly reducing disk space requirements with only a minimal impact on rendering quality. Extensive experiments on 13 scenes, including eight from four public datasets (MatrixCity-Aerial, Mill-19, Tanks \\& Temples, WHU) and five self-collected scenes acquired through UAV photogrammetry measurement from SCUT-CA and plateau regions, further demonstrate the superiority of our method.",

Its versatility enables real-time applications, including on mobile and lower-powered devices. However, 3DGS faces key challenges in virtual reality (VR): (1) temporal artifacts, such as popping during head movements, (2) projection-based distortions that result in disturbing and view-inconsistent floaters, and (3) reduced framerates when rendering large numbers of Gaussians, falling below the critical threshold for VR. Compared to desktop environments, these issues are drastically amplified by large field-of-view, constant head movements, and high resolution of head-mounted displays (HMDs). In this work, we introduce VRSplat: we combine and extend several recent advancements in 3DGS to address challenges of VR holistically. We show how the ideas of Mini-Splatting, StopThePop, and Optimal Projection can complement each other, by modifying the individual techniques and core 3DGS rasterizer. Additionally, we propose an efficient foveated rasterizer that handles focus and peripheral areas in a single GPU launch, avoiding redundant computations and improving GPU utilization. Our method also incorporates a fine-tuning step that optimizes Gaussian parameters based on StopThePop depth evaluations and Optimal Projection. We validate our method through a controlled user study with 25 participants, showing a strong preference for VRSplat over other configurations of Mini-Splatting.

However, most representative methods require RGBD sensors and are only available for indoor environments. The robustness of reconstruction in large-scale outdoor scenarios remains unexplored. This paper introduces a large-scale 3DGS-based visual SLAM with stereo cameras, termed LSG-SLAM. The proposed LSG-SLAM employs a multi-modality strategy to estimate prior poses under large view changes. In tracking, we introduce feature-alignment warping constraints to alleviate the adverse effects of appearance similarity in rendering losses. For the scalability of large-scale scenarios, we introduce continuous Gaussian Splatting submaps to tackle unbounded scenes with limited memory. Loops are detected between GS submaps by place recognition and the relative pose between looped keyframes is optimized utilizing rendering and feature warping losses. After the global optimization of camera poses and Gaussian points, a structure refinement module enhances the reconstruction quality. With extensive evaluations on the EuRoc and KITTI datasets, LSG-SLAM achieves superior performance over existing Neural, 3DGS-based, and even traditional approaches.

    "abstract": "Scaling robot learning requires vast and diverse datasets. Yet the prevailing data collection paradigm-human teleoperation-remains costly and constrained by manual effort and physical robot access. We introduce Real2Render2Real (R2R2R), a novel approach for generating robot training data without relying on object dynamics simulation or teleoperation of robot hardware. The input is a smartphone-captured scan of one or more objects and a single video of a human demonstration. R2R2R renders thousands of high visual fidelity robot-agnostic demonstrations by reconstructing detailed 3D object geometry and appearance, and tracking 6-DoF object motion. R2R2R uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable flexible asset generation and trajectory synthesis for both rigid and articulated objects, converting these representations to meshes to maintain compatibility with scalable rendering engines like IsaacLab but with collision modeling off. Robot demonstration data generated by R2R2R integrates directly with models that operate on robot proprioceptive states and image observations, such as vision-language-action models (VLA) and imitation learning policies. Physical experiments suggest that models trained on R2R2R data from a single human demonstration can match the performance of models trained on 150 human teleoperation demonstrations.

    "abstract": "The computer vision and image processing research community has been involved in standardizing video data communications for the past many decades, leading to standards such as AVC, HEVC, VVC, AV1, AV2, etc. However, recent groundbreaking works have focused on employing deep learning-based techniques to replace the traditional video codec pipeline to a greater affect. Neural video codecs (NVC) create an end-to-end ML-based solution that does not rely on any handcrafted features (motion or edge-based) and have the ability to learn content-aware compression strategies, offering better adaptability and higher compression efficiency than traditional methods. This holds a great potential not only for hardware design, but also for various video streaming platforms and applications, especially video conferencing applications such as MS-Teams or Zoom that have found extensive usage in classrooms and workplaces. However, their high computational demands currently limit their use in real-time applications like video conferencing. To address this, we propose a region-of-interest (ROI) based neural video compression model that leverages 2D Gaussian Splatting. Unlike traditional codecs, 2D Gaussian Splatting is capable of real-time decoding and can be optimized using fewer data points, requiring only thousands of Gaussians for decent quality outputs as opposed to millions in 3D scenes. In this work, we designed a video pipeline that speeds up the encoding time of the previous Gaussian splatting-based image codec by 88% by using a content-aware initialization strategy paired with a novel Gaussian inter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism, enabling Gaussian splatting to be used for a video-codec solution, the first of its kind solution in this neural video codec space.",

    "abstract": "Learning navigation in dynamic open-world environments is an important yet challenging skill for robots. Most previous methods rely on precise localization and mapping or learn from expensive real-world demonstrations. In this paper, we propose the Navigation Diffusion Policy (NavDP), an end-to-end framework trained solely in simulation and can zero-shot transfer to different embodiments in diverse real-world environments. The key ingredient of NavDP's network is the combination of diffusion-based trajectory generation and a critic function for trajectory selection, which are conditioned on only local observation tokens encoded from a shared policy transformer. Given the privileged information of the global environment in simulation, we scale up the demonstrations of good quality to train the diffusion policy and formulate the critic value function targets with contrastive negative samples. Our demonstration generation approach achieves about 2,500 trajectories/GPU per day, 20$\\times$ more efficient than real-world data collection, and results in a large-scale navigation dataset with 363.2km trajectories across 1244 scenes. Trained with this simulation dataset, NavDP achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outstanding generalization capability on quadruped, wheeled, and humanoid robots in diverse indoor and outdoor environments. In addition, we present a preliminary attempt at using Gaussian Splatting to make in-domain real-to-sim fine-tuning to further bridge the sim-to-real gap. Experiments show that adding such real-to-sim data can improve the success rate by 30\\% without hurting its generalization capability.",

Leveraging the spatial information encoded in 3DGS, this work proposes FOCI (Field Overlap Collision Integral), an algorithm that is able to optimize trajectories directly on the Gaussians themselves. FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

Compared to traditional frame-based cameras, event cameras produce sparse yet temporally dense data streams, enabling robust and accurate 3D reconstruction even under challenging conditions such as high-speed motion, low illumination, and extreme dynamic range scenarios. These capabilities offer substantial promise for transformative applications across various fields, including autonomous driving, robotics, aerial navigation, and immersive virtual reality. In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review exclusively dedicated to event-based 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches are systematically categorised based on input modality into stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems, and further classified according to reconstruction methodologies, including geometry-based techniques, deep learning approaches, and neural rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Within each category, methods are chronologically organised to highlight the evolution of key concepts and advancements. Furthermore, we provide a detailed summary of publicly available datasets specifically suited to event-based reconstruction tasks. Finally, we discuss significant open challenges in dataset availability, standardised evaluation, effective representation, and dynamic scene reconstruction, outlining insightful directions for future research. This survey aims to serve as an essential reference and provides a clear and motivating roadmap toward advancing the state of the art in event-driven 3D reconstruction.",

To address this limitation, we propose Anchor-Driven Deformable and Compressed Gaussian Splatting (ADC-GS), a compact and efficient representation for dynamic scene reconstruction. Specifically, ADC-GS organizes Gaussian primitives into an anchor-based structure within the canonical space, enhanced by a temporal significance-based anchor refinement strategy. To reduce deformation redundancy, ADC-GS introduces a hierarchical coarse-to-fine pipeline that captures motions at varying granularities. Moreover, a rate-distortion optimization is adopted to achieve an optimal balance between bitrate consumption and representation fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that ADC-GS outperforms the per-Gaussian deformation approaches in rendering speed by 300%-800% while achieving state-of-the-art storage efficiency without compromising rendering quality.

To address this, we introduce SLAG, a multi-GPU framework for language-augmented Gaussian splatting that enhances the speed and scalability of embedding large scenes. Our method integrates 2D visual-language model features into 3D scenes using SAM and CLIP. Unlike prior approaches, SLAG eliminates the need for a loss function to compute per-Gaussian language embeddings. Instead, it derives embeddings from 3D Gaussian scene parameters via a normalized weighted average, enabling highly parallelized scene encoding. Additionally, we introduce a vector database for efficient embedding storage and retrieval. Our experiments show that SLAG achieves an 18 times speedup in embedding computation on a 16-GPU setup compared to OpenGaussian, while preserving embedding quality on the ScanNet and LERF datasets.

    "abstract": "Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) have become essential for managing cities and integrating complex, heterogeneous data from diverse sources. Creating UDTs involves challenges at multiple process stages, including acquiring accurate 3D source data, reconstructing high-fidelity 3D models, maintaining models' updates, and ensuring seamless interoperability to downstream tasks. Current datasets are usually limited to one part of the processing chain, hampering comprehensive UDTs validation. To address these challenges, we introduce the first comprehensive multimodal Urban Digital Twin benchmark dataset: TUM2TWIN. This dataset includes georeferenced, semantically aligned 3D models and networks along with various terrestrial, mobile, aerial, and satellite observations boasting 32 data subsets over roughly 100,000 $m^2$ and currently 767 GB of data. By ensuring georeferenced indoor-outdoor acquisition, high accuracy, and multimodal data integration, the benchmark supports robust analysis of sensors and the development of advanced reconstruction methods. Additionally, we explore downstream tasks demonstrating the potential of TUM2TWIN, including novel view synthesis of NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, solar potential analysis, point cloud semantic segmentation, and LoD3 building reconstruction. We are convinced this contribution lays a foundation for overcoming current limitations in UDT creation, fostering new research directions and practical solutions for smarter, data-driven urban environments.

However, the task is significantly challenged by the complex interplay between light propagation, water medium, and object surfaces, with existing methods unable to model their interactions accurately. Additionally, expensive training and rendering costs limit their practical application in underwater robotic systems. Therefore, we propose Tensorized Underwater Gaussian Splatting (TUGS), which can effectively solve the modeling challenges of the complex interactions between object geometries and water media while achieving significant parameter reduction. TUGS employs lightweight tensorized higher-order Gaussians with a physics-based underwater Adaptive Medium Estimation (AME) module, enabling accurate simulation of both light attenuation and backscatter effects in underwater environments. Compared to other NeRF-based and GS-based methods designed for underwater, TUGS is able to render high-quality underwater images with faster rendering speeds and less memory usage. Extensive experiments on real-world underwater datasets have demonstrated that TUGS can efficiently achieve superior reconstruction quality using a limited number of parameters, making it particularly suitable for memory-constrained underwater UAV applications",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables the reconstruction of intricate digital 3D assets from multi-view images by leveraging a set of 3D Gaussian primitives for rendering. Its explicit and discrete representation facilitates the seamless composition of complex digital worlds, offering significant advantages over previous neural implicit methods. However, when applied to large-scale compositions, such as crowd-level scenes, it can encompass numerous 3D Gaussians, posing substantial challenges for real-time rendering. To address this, inspired by Unreal Engine 5's Nanite system, we propose Virtualized 3D Gaussians (V3DG), a cluster-based LOD solution that constructs hierarchical 3D Gaussian clusters and dynamically selects only the necessary ones to accelerate rendering speed. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) Offline Build, where hierarchical clusters are generated using a local splatting method to minimize visual differences across granularities, and (2) Online Selection, where footprint evaluation determines perceptible clusters for efficient rasterization during rendering. We curate a dataset of synthetic and real-world scenes, including objects, trees, people, and buildings, each requiring 0.1 billion 3D Gaussians to capture fine details. Experiments show that our solution balances rendering efficiency and visual quality across user-defined tolerances, facilitating downstream interactive applications that compose extensive 3DGS assets for consistent rendering performance.",

    "abstract": "Sparse volumetric reconstruction and rendering via 3D Gaussian splatting have recently enabled animatable 3D head avatars that are rendered under arbitrary viewpoints with impressive photorealism. Today, such photoreal avatars are seen as a key component in emerging applications in telepresence, extended reality, and entertainment. Building a photoreal avatar requires estimating the complex non-rigid motion of different facial components as seen in input video images; due to inaccurate motion estimation, animatable models typically present a loss of fidelity and detail when compared to their non-animatable counterparts, built from an individual facial expression. Also, recent state-of-the-art models are often affected by memory limitations that reduce the number of 3D Gaussians used for modeling, leading to lower detail and quality. To address these problems, we present a new high-detail 3D head avatar model that improves upon the state of the art, largely increasing the number of 3D Gaussians and modeling quality for rendering at 4K resolution. Our high-quality model is reconstructed from multiview input video and builds on top of a mesh-based 3D morphable model, which provides a coarse deformation layer for the head. Photoreal appearance is modelled by 3D Gaussians embedded within the continuous UVD tangent space of this mesh, allowing for more effective densification where most needed. Additionally, these Gaussians are warped by a novel UVD deformation field to capture subtle, localized motion. Our key contribution is the novel deformable Gaussian encoding and overall fitting procedure that allows our head model to preserve appearance detail, while capturing facial motion and other transient high-frequency features such as skin wrinkling.",

We introduce UltraGauss: the first ultrasound-specific Gaussian Splatting framework, extending view synthesis techniques to ultrasound wave propagation. Unlike conventional perspective-based splatting, UltraGauss models probe-plane intersections in 3D, aligning with acoustic image formation. We derive an efficient rasterization boundary formulation for GPU parallelization and introduce a numerically stable covariance parametrization, improving computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. On real clinical ultrasound data, UltraGauss achieves state-of-the-art reconstructions in 5 minutes, and reaching 0.99 SSIM within 20 minutes on a single GPU. A survey of expert clinicians confirms UltraGauss' reconstructions are the most realistic among competing methods. Our CUDA implementation will be released upon publication.",

We introduce QuickSplat, which learns data-driven priors to generate dense initializations for 2D gaussian splatting optimization of large-scale indoor scenes. This provides a strong starting point for the reconstruction, which accelerates the convergence of the optimization and improves the geometry of flat wall structures. We further learn to jointly estimate the densification and update of the scene parameters during each iteration; our proposed densifier network predicts new Gaussians based on the rendering gradients of existing ones, removing the needs of heuristics for densification. Extensive experiments on large-scale indoor scene reconstruction demonstrate the superiority of our data-driven optimization. Concretely, we accelerate runtime by 8x, while decreasing depth errors by up to 48% in comparison to state of the art methods.",

By representing scenes as a mixture of Gaussian primitives, 3DGS leverages GPU rasterization pipelines for efficient rendering and reconstruction. To optimize scene coverage and capture fine details, 3DGS employs a densification algorithm to generate additional points. However, this process often leads to redundant point clouds, resulting in excessive memory usage, slower performance, and substantial storage demands - posing significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that demystifies and improves density control in 3DGS. Our analysis reveals that splitting is crucial for escaping saddle points. Through an optimization-theoretic approach, we establish the necessary conditions for densification, determine the minimal number of offspring Gaussians, identify the optimal parameter update direction, and provide an analytical solution for normalizing off-spring opacity. Building on these insights, we introduce SteepGS, incorporating steepest density control, a principled strategy that minimizes loss while maintaining a compact point cloud. SteepGS achieves a ~50% reduction in Gaussian points without compromising rendering quality, significantly enhancing both efficiency and scalability.",

    "abstract": "Creating high-quality animatable 3D human avatars from a single image remains a significant challenge in computer vision due to the inherent difficulty of reconstructing complete 3D information from a single viewpoint. Current approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences, while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but struggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths of existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details across novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering capabilities. Through our data augmentation pipeline, we overcome the dependency on dense monocular or multi-view training data typically required by traditional 3DGS approaches. Extensive quantitative, qualitative comparisons show our method achieves superior performance across multiple metrics against baseline models. By effectively combining the generative power of diffusion models with both the high-quality results and rendering efficiency of 3DGS, our work establishes a new approach for high-fidelity avatar generation from a single image input.",

Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians.

The latest 3D Gaussian Splatting technique has achieved high quality novel view synthesis as well as fast rendering speed.

This is due to the fact that Gaussian's attributes are primarily tailored and fine-tuned for rendering diverse 2D images by their anisotropic nature. To pave the way for efficient 3D reconstruction, we present Spherical Gaussians, a simple and effective representation for 3D geometric boundaries, from which we can directly reconstruct 3D feature curves from a set of calibrated multi-view images. Spherical Gaussians is optimized from grid initialization with a view-based rendering loss, where a 2D edge map is rendered at a specific view and then compared to the ground-truth edge map extracted from the corresponding image, without the need for any 3D guidance or supervision. Given Spherical Gaussians serve as intermedia for the robust edge representation, we further introduce a novel optimization-based algorithm called SGCR to directly extract accurate parametric curves from aligned Spherical Gaussians. We demonstrate that SGCR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in 3D edge reconstruction while enjoying great efficiency.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) data compression is crucial for enabling efficient storage and transmission in 3D scene modeling. However, its development remains limited due to inadequate entropy models and suboptimal quantization strategies for both lossless and lossy compression scenarios, where existing methods have yet to 1) fully leverage hyperprior information to construct robust conditional entropy models, and 2) apply fine-grained, element-wise quantization strategies for improved compression granularity. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture of Priors (MoP) strategy to simultaneously address these two challenges. Specifically, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, our MoP approach processes hyperprior information through multiple lightweight MLPs to generate diverse prior features, which are subsequently integrated into the MoP feature via a gating mechanism. To enhance lossless compression, the resulting MoP feature is utilized as a hyperprior to improve conditional entropy modeling. Meanwhile, for lossy compression, we employ the MoP feature as guidance information in an element-wise quantization procedure, leveraging a prior-guided Coarse-to-Fine Quantization (C2FQ) strategy with a predefined quantization step value. Specifically, we expand the quantization step value into a matrix and adaptively refine it from coarse to fine granularity, guided by the MoP feature, thereby obtaining a quantization step matrix that facilitates element-wise quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed 3DGS data compression framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including Mip-NeRF360, BungeeNeRF, DeepBlending, and Tank&Temples.",

    "abstract": "Recovering 3D information from scenes via multi-view stereo reconstruction (MVS) and novel view synthesis (NVS) is inherently challenging, particularly in scenarios involving sparse-view setups. The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enabled real-time, photorealistic NVS. Following this, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) leveraged perspective accurate 2D Gaussian primitive rasterization to achieve accurate geometry representation during rendering, improving 3D scene reconstruction while maintaining real-time performance. Recent approaches have tackled the problem of sparse real-time NVS using 3DGS within a generalizable, MVS-based learning framework to regress 3D Gaussian parameters. Our work extends this line of research by addressing the challenge of generalizable sparse 3D reconstruction and NVS jointly, and manages to perform successfully at both tasks. We propose an MVS-based learning pipeline that regresses 2DGS surface element parameters in a feed-forward fashion to perform 3D shape reconstruction and NVS from sparse-view images. We further show that our generalizable pipeline can benefit from preexisting foundational multi-view deep visual features. The resulting model attains the state-of-the-art results on the DTU sparse 3D reconstruction benchmark in terms of Chamfer distance to ground-truth, as-well as state-of-the-art NVS. It also demonstrates strong generalization on the BlendedMVS and Tanks and Temples datasets. We note that our model outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in feed-forward sparse view reconstruction based on volume rendering of implicit representations, while offering an almost 2 orders of magnitude higher inference speed.",

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved breakthrough progress in 3D scene reconstruction and rendering, attracting widespread attention and opening new pathways for 3D garment reconstruction. However, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian primitives, it is difficult to reconstruct high-fidelity, non-watertight 3D garments. In this paper, we present GarmentGS, a dense point cloud-guided method that can reconstruct high-fidelity garment surfaces with high geometric accuracy and generate non-watertight, single-layer meshes. Our method introduces a fast dense point cloud reconstruction module that can complete garment point cloud reconstruction in 10 minutes, compared to traditional methods that require several hours. Furthermore, we use dense point clouds to guide the movement, flattening, and rotation of Gaussian primitives, enabling better distribution on the garment surface to achieve superior rendering effects and geometric accuracy. Through numerical and visual comparisons, our method achieves fast training and real-time rendering while maintaining competitive quality.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art approaches for conditional human body rendering via Gaussian splatting typically focus on simple body motions captured from many views. This is often in the context of dancing or walking. However, for more complex use cases, such as sign language, we care less about large body motion and more about subtle and complex motions of the hands and face. The problems of building high fidelity models are compounded by the complexity of capturing multi-view data of sign. The solution is to make better use of sequence data, ensuring that we can overcome the limited information from only a few views by exploiting temporal variability. Nevertheless, learning from sequence-level data requires extremely accurate and consistent model fitting to ensure that appearance is consistent across complex motions. We focus on how to achieve this, constraining mesh parameters to build an accurate Gaussian splatting framework from few views capable of modelling subtle human motion. We leverage regularization techniques on the Gaussian parameters to mitigate overfitting and rendering artifacts. Additionally, we propose a new adaptive control method to densify Gaussians and prune splat points on the mesh surface. To demonstrate the accuracy of our approach, we render novel sequences of sign language video, building on neural machine translation approaches to sign stitching. On benchmark datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance; and on highly articulated and complex sign language motion, we significantly outperform competing approaches.",

They have long coding times and highly customized data format, making it difficult for widespread deployment. This paper presents a new 3DGS compression framework called HybridGS, which takes advantage of both compact generation and standardized point cloud data encoding. HybridGS first generates compact and explicit 3DGS data. A dual-channel sparse representation is introduced to supervise the primitive position and feature bit depth. It then utilizes a canonical point cloud encoder to perform further data compression and form standard output bitstreams. A simple and effective rate control scheme is proposed to pivot the interpretable data compression scheme. At the current stage, HybridGS does not include any modules aimed at improving 3DGS quality during generation. But experiment results show that it still provides comparable reconstruction performance against state-of-the-art methods, with evidently higher encoding and decoding speed.

However, the quality of underwater images is often degraded due to medium interference, which limits the effectiveness of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pose estimation, leading to subsequent reconstruction failures. Additionally, SfM methods typically operate at slower speeds, further hindering their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we introduce AquaGS, an SfM-free underwater scene reconstruction model based on the SeaThru algorithm, which facilitates rapid and accurate separation of scene details and medium features. Our approach initializes Gaussians by integrating state-of-the-art multi-view stereo (MVS) technology, employs implicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for rendering translucent media and utilizes the latest explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to render object surfaces, which effectively addresses the limitations of traditional methods and accurately simulates underwater optical phenomena.

To address these issues, we propose a novel real-time framework for animatable human avatar reconstruction based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). By leveraging 2DGS and global SMPL pose parameters, our framework not only aligns positional and rotational discrepancies but also enables robust and natural pose-driven animation of the reconstructed avatars. Furthermore, we introduce a Rotation Compensation Network (RCN) that learns rotation residuals by integrating local geometric features with global pose parameters. This network significantly improves the handling of non-rigid deformations and ensures smooth, artifact-free pose transitions during animation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully reconstructs realistic and highly animatable human avatars from monocular videos, effectively preserving fine-grained details while ensuring stable and natural pose variation. Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and animation robustness on public benchmarks.",

Following this, we present Panoramic Space-Time Reconstruction, which leverages a space-time depth estimation method to transform the generated panoramic videos into 4D point clouds, enabling the optimization of a holistic 4D Gaussian Splatting representation to reconstruct spatially and temporally consistent 4D scenes.

We identify that adversaries may implant backdoor views to induce malicious scene confusion during inference, potentially leading to environmental misperception in autonomous navigation or spatial distortion in immersive environments. To uncover this risk, we propose GuassTrap, a novel poisoning attack method targeting 3DGS models. GuassTrap injects malicious views at specific attack viewpoints while preserving high-quality rendering in non-target views, ensuring minimal detectability and maximizing potential harm. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a three-stage pipeline (attack, stabilization, and normal training) to implant stealthy, viewpoint-consistent poisoned renderings in 3DGS, jointly optimizing attack efficacy and perceptual realism to expose security risks in 3D rendering. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GuassTrap can effectively embed imperceptible yet harmful backdoor views while maintaining high-quality rendering in normal views, validating its robustness, adaptability, and practical applicability.",

Visual quality is a critical aspect of 3D reconstruction. Recent advancements such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have notably enhanced the image rendering quality of reconstruction models. Nonetheless, the efficient and effective acquisition of input images for reconstruction-specifically, the selection of the most informative viewpoint-remains an open challenge, which is crucial for active reconstruction. Existing studies have primarily focused on evaluating geometric completeness and exploring unobserved or unknown regions, without direct evaluation of the visual uncertainty within the reconstruction model. To address this gap, this paper introduces a probabilistic model that quantifies visual uncertainty for each Gaussian. Leveraging Shannon Mutual Information, we formulate a criterion, Gaussian Splatting Shannon Mutual Information (GauSS-MI), for real-time assessment of visual mutual information from novel viewpoints, facilitating the selection of next best view. GauSS-MI is implemented within an active reconstruction system integrated with a view and motion planner. Extensive experiments across various simulated and real-world scenes showcase the superior visual quality and reconstruction efficiency performance of the proposed system.",

Recent work on reconstructing the 3D human body using 3DGS attempts to leverage prior information on human pose to enhance rendering quality and improve training speed. However, it struggles to effectively fit dynamic surface planes due to multi-view inconsistency and redundant Gaussians. This inconsistency arises because Gaussian ellipsoids cannot accurately represent the surfaces of dynamic objects, which hinders the rapid reconstruction of the dynamic human body. Meanwhile, the prevalence of redundant Gaussians means that the training time of these works is still not ideal for quickly fitting a dynamic human body. To address these, we propose EfficientHuman, a model that quickly accomplishes the dynamic reconstruction of the human body using Articulated 2D Gaussian while ensuring high rendering quality. The key innovation involves encoding Gaussian splats as Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels in canonical space and then transforming them to pose space via Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) to achieve efficient pose transformations. Unlike 3D Gaussians, Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels can quickly conform to the dynamic human body while ensuring view-consistent geometries. Additionally, we introduce a pose calibration module and an LBS optimization module to achieve precise fitting of dynamic human poses, enhancing the model's performance. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-MoCap dataset demonstrate that EfficientHuman achieves rapid 3D dynamic human reconstruction in less than a minute on average, which is 20 seconds faster than the current state-of-the-art method, while also reducing the number of redundant Gaussians.",

Previous studies have explored the feasibility of 3D editing, but often struggle to generate visually pleasing results, possibly due to the unstable representation learning under mixed optimization of geometry and texture in complicated reconstructed scenarios. In this paper, we aim to provide an accessible solution for ordinary users to create their editable 3D avatars with precise region localization, geometric adaptability, and photorealistic renderings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a meticulously designed framework that decouples the editing process into local spatial adaptation and realistic appearance learning, utilizing a hybrid Tetrahedron-constrained Gaussian Splatting (TetGS) as the underlying representation. TetGS combines the controllable explicit structure of tetrahedral grids with the high-precision rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting and is optimized in a progressive manner comprising three stages: 3D avatar instantiation from real-world monocular videos to provide accurate priors for TetGS initialization; localized spatial adaptation with explicitly partitioned tetrahedrons to guide the redistribution of Gaussian kernels; and geometry-based appearance generation with a coarse-to-fine activation strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach in generating photorealistic 3D editable avatars.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a method for localizing a query image with respect to a precomputed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene representation. First, the method uses 3DGS to render a synthetic RGBD image at some initial pose estimate. Second, it establishes 2D-2D correspondences between the query image and this synthetic image. Third, it uses the depth map to lift the 2D-2D correspondences to 2D-3D correspondences and solves a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem to produce a final pose estimate. Results from evaluation across three existing datasets with 38 scenes and over 2,700 test images show that our method significantly reduces both inference time (by over two orders of magnitude, from more than 10 seconds to as fast as 0.1 seconds) and estimation error compared to baseline methods that use photometric loss minimization. Results also show that our method tolerates large errors in the initial pose estimate of up to 55{\\deg} in rotation and 1.1 units in translation (normalized by scene scale), achieving final pose errors of less than 5{\\deg} in rotation and 0.05 units in translation on 90% of images from the Synthetic NeRF and Mip-NeRF360 datasets and on 42% of images from the more challenging Tanks and Temples dataset.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction and rendering framework termed Mesh-Learner that is natively compatible with traditional rasterization pipelines. It integrates mesh and spherical harmonic (SH) texture (i.e., texture filled with SH coefficients) into the learning process to learn each mesh s view-dependent radiance end-to-end. Images are rendered by interpolating surrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel interpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated to the related SH Texels in SH textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features of rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render, which makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and tasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for robotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast, unlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH textures within the frustum to the GPU for training. At other times, the SH textures are stored in CPU RAM, which results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on interpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2 datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping).

We identify the primary issue behind these low-quality renderings as a visibility mismatch between geometry and appearance, stemming from using these two modalities together. To address this problem, we present CE-NPBG, a new approach for novel view synthesis (NVS) in large-scale autonomous driving scenes. Our method is a neural point-based technique that leverages two modalities: posed images (cameras) and synchronized raw 3D point clouds (LiDAR). We first employ a connectivity relationship graph between appearance and geometry, which retrieves points from a large 3D point cloud map observed from the current camera perspective and uses them for rendering. By leveraging this connectivity, our method significantly improves rendering quality and enhances run-time and scalability by using only a small subset of points from the large 3D point cloud map. Our approach associates neural descriptors with the points and uses them to synthesize views. To enhance the encoding of these descriptors and elevate rendering quality, we propose a joint adversarial and point rasterization training. During training, we pair an image-synthesizer network with a multi-resolution discriminator. At inference, we decouple them and use the image-synthesizer to generate novel views. We also integrate our proposal into the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting work to highlight its benefits for improved rendering and scalability.",

To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: renderability field-guided gaussian splatting (RF-GS). This method quantifies input inhomogeneity through a renderability field, guiding pseudo-view sampling to enhanced visual consistency. To ensure the quality of wide-baseline pseudo-views, we train an image restoration model to map point projections to visible-light styles. Additionally, our validated hybrid data optimization strategy effectively fuses information of pseudo-view angles and source view textures.

In this work, we introduce 4DGS-CC, a contextual coding framework that compresses 4DGS data to meet specific storage constraints. Building upon the established deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method, our approach decomposes 4DGS data into 4D neural voxels and a canonical 3DGS component, which are then compressed using Neural Voxel Contextual Coding (NVCC) and Vector Quantization Contextual Coding (VQCC), respectively. Specifically, we first decompose the 4D neural voxels into distinct quantized features by separating the temporal and spatial dimensions. To losslessly compress each quantized feature, we leverage the previously compressed features from the temporal and spatial dimensions as priors and apply NVCC to generate the spatiotemporal context for contextual coding. Next, we employ a codebook to store spherical harmonics information from canonical 3DGS as quantized vectors, which are then losslessly compressed by using VQCC with the auxiliary learned hyperpriors for contextual coding, thereby reducing redundancy within the codebook. By integrating NVCC and VQCC, our contextual coding framework, 4DGS-CC, enables multi-rate 4DGS data compression tailored to specific storage requirements. Extensive experiments on three 4DGS data compression benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves an average storage reduction of approximately 12 times while maintaining rendering fidelity compared to our baseline 4DGS approach.",

To address this issue, we propose TransparentGS, a fast inverse rendering pipeline for transparent objects based on 3D-GS. The main contributions are three-fold. Firstly, an efficient representation of transparent objects, transparent Gaussian primitives, is designed to enable specular refraction through a deferred refraction strategy. Secondly, we leverage Gaussian light field probes (GaussProbe) to encode both ambient light and nearby contents in a unified framework. Thirdly, a depth-based iterative probes query (IterQuery) algorithm is proposed to reduce the parallax errors in our probe-based framework.

However, rendering large-scale volumes demands powerful GPUs and high-speed memory access for real-time performance. While existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods offer faster rendering speeds with lower hardware requirements, the visible parts of a reconstructed scene are fixed and constrained by preset TF settings, significantly limiting user exploration. This paper introduces inverse volume rendering via Gaussian splatting (iVR-GS), an innovative NVS method that reduces the rendering cost while enabling scene editing for interactive volume exploration. Specifically, we compose multiple iVR-GS models associated with basic TFs covering disjoint visible parts to make the entire volumetric scene visible. Each basic model contains a collection of 3D editable Gaussians, where each Gaussian is a 3D spatial point that supports real-time scene rendering and editing. We demonstrate the superior reconstruction quality and composability of iVR-GS against other NVS solutions (Plenoxels, CCNeRF, and base 3DGS) on various volume datasets.

However, most existing methods rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, limiting their ability to capture detailed scenes in high-contrast environments. While some prior works address high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, they typically require multi-view sharp images with varying exposure times captured at fixed camera positions, which is time-consuming and impractical. To make data acquisition more flexible, we propose \\textbf{Casual3DHDR}, a robust one-stage method that reconstructs 3D HDR scenes from casually-captured auto-exposure (AE) videos, even under severe motion blur and unknown, varying exposure times. Our approach integrates a continuous-time camera trajectory into a unified physical imaging model, jointly optimizing exposure times, camera trajectory, and the camera response function (CRF). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that \\textbf{Casual3DHDR} outperforms existing methods in robustness and rendering quality.

    "abstract": "We investigate data augmentation for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. We utilize recent advancements in 3D reconstruction based on Gaussian Splatting for 3D object placement in driving scenes. Unlike existing diffusion-based methods that synthesize images conditioned on BEV layouts, our approach places 3D objects directly in the reconstructed 3D space with explicitly imposed geometric transformations. This ensures both the physical plausibility of object placement and highly accurate 3D pose and position annotations.   Our experiments demonstrate that even by integrating a limited number of external 3D objects into real scenes, the augmented data significantly enhances 3D object detection performance and outperforms existing diffusion-based 3D augmentation for object detection. Extensive testing on the nuScenes dataset reveals that imposing high geometric diversity in object placement has a greater impact compared to the appearance diversity of objects. Additionally, we show that generating hard examples, either by maximizing detection loss or imposing high visual occlusion in camera images, does not lead to more efficient 3D data augmentation for camera-based 3D object detection in autonomous driving.",

We propose PIN-WM, a Physics-INformed World Model that enables efficient end-to-end identification of a 3D rigid body dynamical system from visual observations. Adopting differentiable physics simulation, PIN-WM can be learned with only few-shot and task-agnostic physical interaction trajectories. Further, PIN-WM is learned with observational loss induced by Gaussian Splatting without needing state estimation. To bridge Sim2Real gaps, we turn the learned PIN-WM into a group of Digital Cousins via physics-aware randomizations which perturb physics and rendering parameters to generate diverse and meaningful variations of the PIN-WM. Extensive evaluations on both simulation and real-world tests demonstrate that PIN-WM, enhanced with physics-aware digital cousins, facilitates learning robust non-prehensile manipulation skills with Sim2Real transfer, surpassing the Real2Sim2Real state-of-the-arts.",

In this work, we propose ToF-Splatting, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM pipeline tailored for using effectively very sparse ToF input data. Our approach improves upon the state of the art by introducing a multi-frame integration module, which produces dense depth maps by merging cues from extremely sparse ToF depth, monocular color, and multi-view geometry.

This paper extends 3DGS capabilities to inpainting, where masked objects in a scene are replaced with new contents that blend seamlessly with the surroundings. Unlike 2D image inpainting, 3D Gaussian inpainting (3DGI) is challenging in effectively leveraging complementary visual and semantic cues from multiple input views, as occluded areas in one view may be visible in others. To address this, we propose a method that measures the visibility uncertainties of 3D points across different input views and uses them to guide 3DGI in utilizing complementary visual cues. We also employ uncertainties to learn a semantic concept of scene without the masked object and use a diffusion model to fill masked objects in input images based on the learned concept. Finally, we build a novel 3DGI framework, VISTA, by integrating VISibility-uncerTainty-guided 3DGI with scene conceptuAl learning. VISTA generates high-quality 3DGS models capable of synthesizing artifact-free and naturally inpainted novel views. Furthermore, our approach extends to handling dynamic distractors arising from temporal object changes, enhancing its versatility in diverse scene reconstruction scenarios. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art techniques using two challenging datasets: the SPIn-NeRF dataset, featuring 10 diverse static 3D inpainting scenes, and an underwater 3D inpainting dataset derived from UTB180, including fast-moving fish as inpainting targets.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic videos with small baseline motions are ubiquitous in daily life, especially on social media. However, these videos present a challenge to existing pose estimation frameworks due to ambiguous features, drift accumulation, and insufficient triangulation constraints. Gaussian splatting, which maintains an explicit representation for scenes, provides a reliable novel view rasterization when the viewpoint change is small. Inspired by this, we propose SmallGS, a camera pose estimation framework that is specifically designed for small-baseline videos. SmallGS optimizes sequential camera poses using Gaussian splatting, which reconstructs the scene from the first frame in each video segment to provide a stable reference for the rest. The temporal consistency of Gaussian splatting within limited viewpoint differences reduced the requirement of sufficient depth variations in traditional camera pose estimation. We further incorporate pretrained robust visual features, e.g. DINOv2, into Gaussian splatting, where high-dimensional feature map rendering enhances the robustness of camera pose estimation. By freezing the Gaussian splatting and optimizing camera viewpoints based on rasterized features, SmallGS effectively learns camera poses without requiring explicit feature correspondences or strong parallax motion. We verify the effectiveness of SmallGS in small-baseline videos in TUM-Dynamics sequences, which achieves impressive accuracy in camera pose estimation compared to MonST3R and DORID-SLAM for small-baseline videos in dynamic scenes.

We propose StyleMe3D, a holistic framework for 3D GS style transfer that integrates multi-modal style conditioning, multi-level semantic alignment, and perceptual quality enhancement. Our key insights include: (1) optimizing only RGB attributes preserves geometric integrity during stylization; (2) disentangling low-, medium-, and high-level semantics is critical for coherent style transfer; (3) scalability across isolated objects and complex scenes is essential for practical deployment. StyleMe3D introduces four novel components: Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD), leveraging Stable Diffusion's latent space for semantic alignment; Contrastive Style Descriptor (CSD) for localized, content-aware texture transfer; Simultaneously Optimized Scale (SOS) to decouple style details and structural coherence; and 3D Gaussian Quality Assessment (3DG-QA), a differentiable aesthetic prior trained on human-rated data to suppress artifacts and enhance visual harmony. Evaluated on NeRF synthetic dataset (objects) and tandt db (scenes) datasets, StyleMe3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving geometric details (e.g., carvings on sculptures) and ensuring stylistic consistency across scenes (e.g., coherent lighting in landscapes), while maintaining real-time rendering.

    "abstract": "Spine surgery is a high-risk intervention demanding precise execution, often supported by image-based navigation systems. Recently, supervised learning approaches have gained attention for reconstructing 3D spinal anatomy from sparse fluoroscopic data, significantly reducing reliance on radiation-intensive 3D imaging systems. However, these methods typically require large amounts of annotated training data and may struggle to generalize across varying patient anatomies or imaging conditions. Instance-learning approaches like Gaussian splatting could offer an alternative by avoiding extensive annotation requirements. While Gaussian splatting has shown promise for novel view synthesis, its application to sparse, arbitrarily posed real intraoperative X-rays has remained largely unexplored. This work addresses this limitation by extending the $R^2$-Gaussian splatting framework to reconstruct anatomically consistent 3D volumes under these challenging conditions. We introduce an anatomy-guided radiographic standardization step using style transfer, improving visual consistency across views, and enhancing reconstruction quality. Notably, our framework requires no pretraining, making it inherently adaptable to new patients and anatomies. We evaluated our approach using an ex-vivo dataset. Expert surgical evaluation confirmed the clinical utility of the 3D reconstructions for navigation, especially when using 20 to 30 views, and highlighted the standardization's benefit for anatomical clarity. Benchmarking via quantitative 2D metrics (PSNR/SSIM) confirmed performance trade-offs compared to idealized settings, but also validated the improvement gained from standardization over raw inputs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of instance-based volumetric reconstruction from arbitrary sparse-view X-rays, advancing intraoperative 3D imaging for surgical navigation.",

Recently, many methods based on the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework have been proposed to address sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Although these methods have made considerable advancements, they still show significant issues with overfitting. To reduce the overfitting, we introduce VGNC, a novel Validation-guided Gaussian Number Control (VGNC) approach based on generative novel view synthesis (NVS) models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to alleviate the overfitting issue of sparse-view 3DGS with generative validation images. Specifically, we first introduce a validation image generation method based on a generative NVS model. We then propose a Gaussian number control strategy that utilizes generated validation images to determine the optimal Gaussian numbers, thereby reducing the issue of overfitting. We conducted detailed experiments on various sparse-view 3DGS baselines and datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of VGNC. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only reduces overfitting but also improves rendering quality on the test set while decreasing the number of Gaussian points. This reduction lowers storage demands and accelerates both training and rendering. The code will be released.",

Encoding Gaussian point features with anchor embeddings has significantly enhanced the performance of newer 3DGS variants. While significant advances have been made, it is still challenging to boost rendering performance. Feature embeddings have difficulty accurately representing colors from different perspectives under varying lighting conditions, which leads to a washed-out appearance. Another reason is the lack of a proper densification strategy that prevents Gaussian point growth in thinly initialized areas, resulting in blurriness and needle-shaped artifacts. To address them, we propose Metamon-GS, from innovative viewpoints of variance-guided densification strategy and multi-level hash grid. The densification strategy guided by variance specifically targets Gaussians with high gradient variance in pixels and compensates for the importance of regions with extra Gaussians to improve reconstruction. The latter studies implicit global lighting conditions and accurately interprets color from different perspectives and feature embeddings. Our thorough experiments on publicly available datasets show that Metamon-GS surpasses its baseline model and previous versions, delivering superior quality in rendering novel views.",

    "abstract": "Creating photorealistic 3D head avatars from limited input has become increasingly important for applications in virtual reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While recent advances like neural rendering and 3D Gaussian splatting have enabled high-quality digital human avatar creation and animation, most methods rely on multiple images or multi-view inputs, limiting their practicality for real-world use. In this paper, we propose SEGA, a novel approach for Single-imagE-based 3D drivable Gaussian head Avatar creation that combines generalized prior models with a new hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework. SEGA seamlessly combines priors derived from large-scale 2D datasets with 3D priors learned from multi-view, multi-expression, and multi-ID data, achieving robust generalization to unseen identities while ensuring 3D consistency across novel viewpoints and expressions. We further present a hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework that leverages FLAME-based structural priors and employs a dual-branch architecture to disentangle dynamic and static facial components effectively. The dynamic branch encodes expression-driven fine details, while the static branch focuses on expression-invariant regions, enabling efficient parameter inference and precomputation. This design maximizes the utility of limited 3D data and achieves real-time performance for animation and rendering. Additionally, SEGA performs person-specific fine-tuning to further enhance the fidelity and realism of the generated avatars. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in generalization ability, identity preservation, and expression realism, advancing one-shot avatar creation for practical applications.",

However, existing datasets fail to include the specific challenges of both fields, such as multimodality and sequentiality in SLAM or generalization across viewpoints and illumination conditions in neural rendering. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLAM&Render, a novel dataset designed to benchmark methods in the intersection between SLAM and novel view rendering. It consists of 40 sequences with synchronized RGB, depth, IMU, robot kinematic data, and ground-truth pose streams. By releasing robot kinematic data, the dataset also enables the assessment of novel SLAM strategies when applied to robot manipulators. The dataset sequences span five different setups featuring consumer and industrial objects under four different lighting conditions, with separate training and test trajectories per scene, as well as object rearrangements. Our experimental results, obtained with several baselines from the literature, validate SLAM&Render as a relevant benchmark for this emerging research area.",

    "abstract": "Realizing green communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images at high frequencies through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR (GSRMR), which achieves a lower energy consumption and makes a concrete step towards green RoboMR. The crux to GSRMR is to build a GS model which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a photo-realistic view from the robot's pose, thereby reducing the need for excessive image uploads. Since the GS model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or not) and power allocation across different frames. The GSCLO problem is solved by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSRMR reduces the communication energy by over 10x compared with RoboMR. Furthermore, the proposed GSRMR with APO outperforms extensive baseline schemes, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM).",

Recent methods have adopt 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to produce 3D scenes due to its efficient training process. However, these methodologies may generate incomplete 3D scenes or blurred multiviews. This is because of (1) inaccurate 3DGS point initialization and (2) the tendency of 3DGS to flatten 3D Gaussians with the sparse-view input. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework EG-Gaussian, which utilizes epipolar geometry and graph networks for 3D scene reconstruction. Initially, we integrate epipolar geometry into the 3DGS initialization phase to enhance initial 3DGS point construction. Then, we specifically design a graph learning module to refine 3DGS spatial features, in which we incorporate both spatial coordinates and angular relationships among neighboring points. Experiments on indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves reconstruction accuracy compared to 3DGS-based methods.",

    "abstract": "While HPC resources are increasingly being used to produce adaptively refined or unstructured volume datasets, current research in applying machine learning-based representation to visualization has largely ignored this type of data. To address this, we introduce Volume Encoding Gaussians (VEG), a novel 3D Gaussian-based representation for scientific volume visualization focused on unstructured volumes. Unlike prior 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods that store view-dependent color and opacity for each Gaussian, VEG decouple the visual appearance from the data representation by encoding only scalar values, enabling transfer-function-agnostic rendering of 3DGS models for interactive scientific visualization. VEG are directly initialized from volume datasets, eliminating the need for structure-from-motion pipelines like COLMAP. To ensure complete scalar field coverage, we introduce an opacity-guided training strategy, using differentiable rendering with multiple transfer functions to optimize our data representation. This allows VEG to preserve fine features across the full scalar range of a dataset while remaining independent of any specific transfer function. Each Gaussian is scaled and rotated to adapt to local geometry, allowing for efficient representation of unstructured meshes without storing mesh connectivity and while using far fewer primitives. Across a diverse set of data, VEG achieve high reconstruction quality, compress large volume datasets by up to 3600x, and support lightning-fast rendering on commodity GPUs, enabling interactive visualization of large-scale structured and unstructured volumes.",

    "abstract": "Visuomotor policies learned from teleoperated demonstrations face challenges such as lengthy data collection, high costs, and limited data diversity. Existing approaches address these issues by augmenting image observations in RGB space or employing Real-to-Sim-to-Real pipelines based on physical simulators. However, the former is constrained to 2D data augmentation, while the latter suffers from imprecise physical simulation caused by inaccurate geometric reconstruction. This paper introduces RoboSplat, a novel method that generates diverse, visually realistic demonstrations by directly manipulating 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we reconstruct the scene through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), directly edit the reconstructed scene, and augment data across six types of generalization with five techniques: 3D Gaussian replacement for varying object types, scene appearance, and robot embodiments; equivariant transformations for different object poses; visual attribute editing for various lighting conditions; novel view synthesis for new camera perspectives; and 3D content generation for diverse object types. Comprehensive real-world experiments demonstrate that RoboSplat significantly enhances the generalization of visuomotor policies under diverse disturbances. Notably, while policies trained on hundreds of real-world demonstrations with additional 2D data augmentation achieve an average success rate of 57.2%, RoboSplat attains 87.8% in one-shot settings across six types of generalization in the real world.",

In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs camera tracking, human pose estimation and human-scene reconstruction in an online fashion. 3D Gaussian Splatting is utilized to learn Gaussian primitives for humans and scenes efficiently, and reconstruction-based camera tracking and human pose estimation modules are designed to enable holistic understanding and effective disentanglement of pose and appearance. Specifically, we design a human deformation module to reconstruct the details and enhance generalizability to out-of-distribution poses faithfully. Aiming to learn the spatial correlation between human and scene accurately, we introduce occlusion-aware human silhouette rendering and monocular geometric priors, which further improve reconstruction quality.

While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast and high-quality scene reconstruction, research has also explored incorporating open-vocabulary understanding into 3DGS. However, most existing methods require iterative optimization over per-view 2D semantic feature maps, which not only results in inefficiencies but also leads to inconsistent 3D semantics across views. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free framework that constructs a superpoint graph directly from Gaussian primitives. The superpoint graph partitions the scene into spatially compact and semantically coherent regions, forming view-consistent 3D entities and providing a structured foundation for open-vocabulary understanding. Based on the graph structure, we design an efficient reprojection strategy that lifts 2D semantic features onto the superpoints, avoiding costly multi-view iterative training. The resulting representation ensures strong 3D semantic coherence and naturally supports hierarchical understanding, enabling both coarse- and fine-grained open-vocabulary perception within a unified semantic field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation performance, with semantic field reconstruction completed over $30\\times$ faster.

To enable future photorealistic 3D immersive visual communication applications, significant compression is essential for transmission over the existing Internet infrastructure. Hence, we propose Compressed Gaussian Splatting (CompGS++), a novel framework that leverages compact Gaussian primitives to achieve accurate 3D modeling with substantial size reduction for both static and dynamic scenes. Our design is based on the principle of eliminating redundancy both between and within primitives. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive prediction paradigm to address inter-primitive redundancy through spatial and temporal primitive prediction modules. The spatial primitive prediction module establishes predictive relationships for scene primitives and enables most primitives to be encoded as compact residuals, substantially reducing the spatial redundancy. We further devise a temporal primitive prediction module to handle dynamic scenes, which exploits primitive correlations across timestamps to effectively reduce temporal redundancy. Moreover, we devise a rate-constrained optimization module that jointly minimizes reconstruction error and rate consumption. This module effectively eliminates parameter redundancy within primitives and enhances the overall compactness of scene representations. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CompGS++ significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior compression performance while preserving accurate scene modeling. Our implementation will be made publicly available on GitHub to facilitate further research.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is widely used for novel view synthesis due to its high rendering quality and fast inference time. However, 3DGS predominantly relies on first-order optimizers such as Adam, which leads to long training times. To address this limitation, we propose a novel second-order optimization strategy based on Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Conjugate Gradient (CG), which we specifically tailor towards Gaussian Splatting. Our key insight is that the Jacobian in 3DGS exhibits significant sparsity since each Gaussian affects only a limited number of pixels. We exploit this sparsity by proposing a matrix-free and GPU-parallelized LM optimization. To further improve its efficiency, we propose sampling strategies for both the camera views and loss function and, consequently, the normal equation, significantly reducing the computational complexity. In addition, we increase the convergence rate of the second-order approximation by introducing an effective heuristic to determine the learning rate that avoids the expensive computation cost of line search methods. As a result, our method achieves a $3\\times$ speedup over standard LM and outperforms Adam by $~6\\times$ when the Gaussian count is low while remaining competitive for moderate counts.

Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space planes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical rasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution evaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for out-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the effective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring real-time, artifact-free rendering.",

We introduce CAGE-GS, a cage-based 3DGS deformation method that seamlessly aligns a source 3DGS scene with a user-defined target shape. Our approach learns a deformation cage from the target, which guides the geometric transformation of the source scene. While the cages effectively control structural alignment, preserving the textural appearance of 3DGS remains challenging due to the complexity of covariance parameters. To address this, we employ a Jacobian matrix-based strategy to update the covariance parameters of each Gaussian, ensuring texture fidelity post-deformation. Our method is highly flexible, accommodating various target shape representations, including texts, images, point clouds, meshes and 3DGS models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on both public datasets and newly proposed scenes demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques in both efficiency and deformation quality.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing transparent surfaces is essential for tasks such as robotic manipulation in labs, yet it poses a significant challenge for 3D reconstruction techniques like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). These methods often encounter a transparency-depth dilemma, where the pursuit of photorealistic rendering through standard $\\alpha$-blending undermines geometric precision, resulting in considerable depth estimation errors for transparent materials. To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface Gaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning from appearance refinement. In the geometry learning stage, TSGS focuses on geometry by using specular-suppressed inputs to accurately represent surfaces. In the second stage, TSGS improves visual fidelity through anisotropic specular modeling, crucially maintaining the established opacity to ensure geometric accuracy. To enhance depth inference, TSGS employs a first-surface depth extraction method. This technique uses a sliding window over $\\alpha$-blending weights to pinpoint the most likely surface location and calculates a robust weighted average depth. To evaluate the transparent surface reconstruction task under realistic conditions, we collect a TransLab dataset that includes complex transparent laboratory glassware. Extensive experiments on TransLab show that TSGS achieves accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering of transparent objects simultaneously within the efficient 3DGS framework. Specifically, TSGS significantly surpasses current leading methods, achieving a 37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score compared to the top baseline.

    "abstract": "Drag-driven editing has become popular among designers for its ability to modify complex geometric structures through simple and intuitive manipulation, allowing users to adjust and reshape content with minimal technical skill. This drag operation has been incorporated into numerous methods to facilitate the editing of 2D images and 3D meshes in design. However, few studies have explored drag-driven editing for the widely-used 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, as deforming 3DGS while preserving shape coherence and visual continuity remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce ARAP-GS, a drag-driven 3DGS editing framework based on As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) deformation. Unlike previous 3DGS editing methods, we are the first to apply ARAP deformation directly to 3D Gaussians, enabling flexible, drag-driven geometric transformations. To preserve scene appearance after deformation, we incorporate an advanced diffusion prior for image super-resolution within our iterative optimization process. This approach enhances visual quality while maintaining multi-view consistency in the edited results. Experiments show that ARAP-GS outperforms current methods across diverse 3D scenes, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority for drag-driven 3DGS editing. Additionally, our method is highly efficient, requiring only 10 to 20 minutes to edit a scene on a single RTX 3090 GPU.",

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding is crucial for applications requiring natural language-driven spatial interpretation, such as robotics and augmented reality. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a powerful representation for scene reconstruction, integrating it with open-vocabulary frameworks reveals a key challenge: cross-view granularity inconsistency. This issue, stemming from 2D segmentation methods like SAM, results in inconsistent object segmentations across views (e.g., a \"coffee set\" segmented as a single entity in one view but as \"cup + coffee + spoon\" in another). Existing 3DGS-based methods often rely on isolated per-Gaussian feature learning, neglecting the spatial context needed for cohesive object reasoning, leading to fragmented representations. We propose Context-Aware Gaussian Splatting (CAGS), a novel framework that addresses this challenge by incorporating spatial context into 3DGS. CAGS constructs local graphs to propagate contextual features across Gaussians, reducing noise from inconsistent granularity, employs mask-centric contrastive learning to smooth SAM-derived features across views, and leverages a precomputation strategy to reduce computational cost by precomputing neighborhood relationships, enabling efficient training in large-scale scenes. By integrating spatial context, CAGS significantly improves 3D instance segmentation and reduces fragmentation errors on datasets like LERF-OVS and ScanNet, enabling robust language-guided 3D scene understanding.",

Recent studies on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have achieved remarkable results in scene reconstruction. However, they typically rely on multi-view image inputs and require prolonged optimization times. In this paper, we propose BEV-GS, a real-time single-frame road surface reconstruction method based on feed-forward Gaussian splatting. BEV-GS consists of a prediction module and a rendering module. The prediction module introduces separate geometry and texture networks following Bird's-Eye-View paradigm. Geometric and texture parameters are directly estimated from a single frame, avoiding per-scene optimization. In the rendering module, we utilize grid Gaussian for road surface representation and novel view synthesis, which better aligns with road surface characteristics. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the real-world dataset RSRD. The road elevation error reduces to 1.73 cm, and the PSNR of novel view synthesis reaches 28.36 dB. The prediction and rendering FPS is 26, and 2061, respectively, enabling high-accuracy and real-time applications.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting reconstructs scenes by starting from a sparse Structure-from-Motion initialization and iteratively refining under-reconstructed regions. This process is inherently slow, as it requires multiple densification steps where Gaussians are repeatedly split and adjusted, following a lengthy optimization path. Moreover, this incremental approach often leads to suboptimal renderings, particularly in high-frequency regions where detail is critical.   We propose a fundamentally different approach: we eliminate densification process with a one-step approximation of scene geometry using triangulated pixels from dense image correspondences. This dense initialization allows us to estimate rough geometry of the scene while preserving rich details from input RGB images, providing each Gaussian with well-informed colors, scales, and positions. As a result, we dramatically shorten the optimization path and remove the need for densification. Unlike traditional methods that rely on sparse keypoints, our dense initialization ensures uniform detail across the scene, even in high-frequency regions where 3DGS and other methods struggle. Moreover, since all splats are initialized in parallel at the start of optimization, we eliminate the need to wait for densification to adjust new Gaussians.   Our method not only outperforms speed-optimized models in training efficiency but also achieves higher rendering quality than state-of-the-art approaches, all while using only half the splats of standard 3DGS. It is fully compatible with other 3DGS acceleration techniques, making it a versatile and efficient solution that can be integrated with existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "3D affordance reasoning is essential in associating human instructions with the functional regions of 3D objects, facilitating precise, task-oriented manipulations in embodied AI. However, current methods, which predominantly depend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and robustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent sparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers high-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by representing scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as a highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and improving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains largely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance datasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning. This dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances, and 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object categories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce AffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning using 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal structure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align 3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat dataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain, while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen and unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.",

The lightweight and differentiable representation of the radiance field using the Gaussian enables rapid and high-quality reconstruction and fast rendering. However, reconstructing objects with high-frequency surface textures (e.g., fine stripes) requires many skinny Gaussian kernels because each Gaussian represents only one color if viewed from one direction. Thus, reconstructing the stripes pattern, for example, requires Gaussians for at least the number of stripes. We present 3D Gabor splatting, which augments the Gaussian kernel to represent spatially high-frequency signals using Gabor noise. The Gabor kernel is a combination of a Gaussian term and spatially fluctuating wave functions, making it suitable for representing spatial high-frequency texture. We demonstrate that our 3D Gabor splatting can reconstruct various high-frequency textures on the objects.",

Previous works utilize neural fields together with physically based rendering (PBR), to estimate geometry and disentangle appearance properties of human avatars. However, one drawback of these methods is the slow rendering speed due to the expensive Monte Carlo ray tracing. To tackle this problem, we proposed to distill the knowledge from implicit neural fields (teacher) to explicit 2D Gaussian splatting (student) representation to take advantage of the fast rasterization property of Gaussian splatting. To avoid ray-tracing, we employ the split-sum approximation for PBR appearance. We also propose novel part-wise ambient occlusion probes for shadow computation. Shadow prediction is achieved by querying these probes only once per pixel, which paves the way for real-time relighting of avatars. These techniques combined give high-quality relighting results with realistic shadow effects. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed student model achieves comparable or even better relighting results with our teacher model while being 370 times faster at inference time, achieving a 67 FPS rendering speed.",

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis (NVS) in low-light scenes remains a significant challenge due to degraded inputs characterized by severe noise, low dynamic range (LDR) and unreliable initialization. While recent NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results, most suffer from high computational costs, and some rely on carefully captured or pre-processed data--such as RAW sensor inputs or multi-exposure sequences--which severely limits their practicality. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with competitive visual fidelity; however, existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with low-light sRGB inputs, resulting in unstable Gaussian initialization and ineffective noise suppression. To address these challenges, we propose LL-Gaussian, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and enhancement from low-light sRGB images, enabling pseudo normal-light novel view synthesis. Our method introduces three key innovations: 1) an end-to-end Low-Light Gaussian Initialization Module (LLGIM) that leverages dense priors from learning-based MVS approach to generate high-quality initial point clouds; 2) a dual-branch Gaussian decomposition model that disentangles intrinsic scene properties (reflectance and illumination) from transient interference, enabling stable and interpretable optimization; 3) an unsupervised optimization strategy guided by both physical constrains and diffusion prior to jointly steer decomposition and enhancement. Additionally, we contribute a challenging dataset collected in extreme low-light environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of LL-Gaussian. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, LL-Gaussian achieves up to 2,000 times faster inference and reduces training time to just 2%, while delivering superior reconstruction and rendering quality.",

    "abstract": "While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves photorealistic novel view synthesis, its performance degrades with motion blur. In scenarios with rapid motion or low-light conditions, existing RGB-based deblurring methods struggle to model camera pose and radiance changes during exposure, reducing reconstruction accuracy. Event cameras, capturing continuous brightness changes during exposure, can effectively assist in modeling motion blur and improving reconstruction quality. Therefore, we propose Event-driven Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting (EBAD-Gaussian), which reconstructs sharp 3D Gaussians from event streams and severely blurred images. This method jointly learns the parameters of these Gaussians while recovering camera motion trajectories during exposure time. Specifically, we first construct a blur loss function by synthesizing multiple latent sharp images during the exposure time, minimizing the difference between real and synthesized blurred images. Then we use event stream to supervise the light intensity changes between latent sharp images at any time within the exposure period, supplementing the light intensity dynamic changes lost in RGB images. Furthermore, we optimize the latent sharp images at intermediate exposure times based on the event-based double integral (EDI) prior, applying consistency constraints to enhance the details and texture information of the reconstructed images. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that EBAD-Gaussian can achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction under the condition of blurred images and event stream inputs.",

    "abstract": "Single-image 3D scene reconstruction presents significant challenges due to its inherently ill-posed nature and limited input constraints. Recent advances have explored two promising directions: multiview generative models that train on 3D consistent datasets but struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, and 3D scene inpainting and completion frameworks that suffer from cross-view inconsistency and suboptimal error handling, as they depend exclusively on depth data or 3D smoothness, which ultimately degrades output quality and computational performance. Building upon these approaches, we present GaussVideoDreamer, which advances generative multimedia approaches by bridging the gap between image, video, and 3D generation, integrating their strengths through two key innovations: (1) A progressive video inpainting strategy that harnesses temporal coherence for improved multiview consistency and faster convergence. (2) A 3D Gaussian Splatting consistency mask to guide the video diffusion with 3D consistent multiview evidence. Our pipeline combines three core components: a geometry-aware initialization protocol, Inconsistency-Aware Gaussian Splatting, and a progressive video inpainting strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 32% higher LLaVA-IQA scores and at least 2x speedup compared to existing methods while maintaining robust performance across diverse scenes.",

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is widely known for high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, even the state-of-the-art NeRF model, Gaussian Splatting, requires minutes for training, far from the real-time performance required by multimedia scenarios like telemedicine. One of the obstacles is its inefficient sampling, which is only partially addressed by existing works. Existing point-sampling algorithms uniformly sample simple-texture regions (easy to fit) and complex-texture regions (hard to fit), while existing ray-sampling algorithms sample these regions all in the finest granularity (i.e. the pixel level), both wasting GPU training resources. Actually, regions with different texture intensities require different sampling granularities. To this end, we propose a novel dynamic-resolution ray-sampling algorithm, MCBlock, which employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to partition each training image into pixel blocks with different sizes for active block-wise training. Specifically, the trees are initialized according to the texture of training images to boost the initialization speed, and an expansion/pruning module dynamically optimizes the block partition. MCBlock is implemented in Nerfstudio, an open-source toolset, and achieves a training acceleration of up to 2.33x, surpassing other ray-sampling algorithms. We believe MCBlock can apply to any cone-tracing NeRF model and contribute to the multimedia community.",

However, while many methods focus on geometric consistency, they often neglect the potential of text-driven guidance to enhance semantic understanding, which is crucial for accurately reconstructing fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose TextSplat--the first text-driven Generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework. By employing a text-guided fusion of diverse semantic cues, our framework learns robust cross-modal feature representations that improve the alignment of geometric and semantic information, producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. Specifically, our framework employs three parallel modules to obtain complementary representations: the Diffusion Prior Depth Estimator for accurate depth information, the Semantic Aware Segmentation Network for detailed semantic information, and the Multi-View Interaction Network for refined cross-view features. Then, in the Text-Guided Semantic Fusion Module, these representations are integrated via the text-guided and attention-based feature aggregation mechanism, resulting in enhanced 3D Gaussian parameters enriched with detailed semantic cues. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework.

As the number of training views decreases, the novel view synthesis task degrades to a highly under-determined problem such that existing methods suffer from the notorious overfitting issue. Interestingly, we observe that models with fewer Gaussian primitives exhibit less overfitting under sparse inputs. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Random Dropout Regularization (RDR) to exploit the advantages of low-complexity models to alleviate overfitting. In addition, to remedy the lack of high-frequency details for these models, an Edge-guided Splitting Strategy (ESS) is developed. With these two techniques, our method (termed DropoutGS) provides a simple yet effective plug-in approach to improve the generalization performance of existing 3DGS methods.

Typically, the initialization is taken from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms; however, SfM is time-consuming and restricts the application of 3DGS in real-world scenarios and large-scale scene reconstruction. We introduce a constrained optimization method for simultaneous camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction that does not require SfM support. Core to our approach is decomposing a camera pose into a sequence of camera-to-(device-)center and (device-)center-to-world optimizations. To facilitate, we propose two optimization constraints conditioned to the sensitivity of each parameter group and restricts each parameter's search space. In addition, as we learn the scene geometry directly from the noisy point clouds, we propose geometric constraints to improve the reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing (multi-modal) 3DGS baseline and methods supplemented by COLMAP on both our collected dataset and two public benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3Ds of hand-object interaction (HOI) is a fundamental problem that can find numerous applications. Despite recent advances, there is no comprehensive pipeline yet for bimanual class-agnostic interaction reconstruction from a monocular RGB video, where two hands and an unknown object are interacting with each other. Previous works tackled the limited hand-object interaction case, where object templates are pre-known or only one hand is involved in the interaction. The bimanual interaction reconstruction exhibits severe occlusions introduced by complex interactions between two hands and an object. To solve this, we first introduce BIGS (Bimanual Interaction 3D Gaussian Splatting), a method that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of hands and an unknown object from a monocular video. To robustly obtain object Gaussians avoiding severe occlusions, we leverage prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model with score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to reconstruct unseen object parts. For hand Gaussians, we exploit the 3D priors of hand model (i.e., MANO) and share a single Gaussian for two hands to effectively accumulate hand 3D information, given limited views. To further consider the 3D alignment between hands and objects, we include the interacting-subjects optimization step during Gaussian optimization. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on two challenging datasets, in terms of 3D hand pose estimation (MPJPE), 3D object reconstruction (CDh, CDo, F10), and rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), respectively.",

    "abstract": "Recently, reconstructing scenes from a single panoramic image using advanced 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques has attracted growing interest. Panoramic images offer a 360$\\times$ 180 field of view (FoV), capturing the entire scene in a single shot. However, panoramic images introduce severe distortion, making it challenging to render 3D Gaussians into 2D distorted equirectangular space directly. Converting equirectangular images to cubemap projections partially alleviates this problem but introduces new challenges, such as projection distortion and discontinuities across cube-face boundaries. To address these limitations, we present a novel framework, named TPGS, to bridge continuous panoramic 3D scene reconstruction with perspective Gaussian splatting. Firstly, we introduce a Transition Plane between adjacent cube faces to enable smoother transitions in splatting directions and mitigate optimization ambiguity in the boundary region. Moreover, an intra-to-inter face optimization strategy is proposed to enhance local details and restore visual consistency across cube-face boundaries. Specifically, we optimize 3D Gaussians within individual cube faces and then fine-tune them in the stitched panoramic space. Additionally, we introduce a spherical sampling technique to eliminate visible stitching seams. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor, egocentric, and roaming benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, our approach considers the content-complexity variation across different regions and balances computational load during scene partitioning, enabling efficient scene reconstruction. To tackle the supervision mismatch issue during independent block optimization, we introduce auxiliary points during individual block optimization to align the ground-truth supervision, which enhances the reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-view geometry constraint that effectively mitigates rendering degradation caused by airspace floaters during block merging.

However, multi-granularity interaction remains a challenging task due to the ambiguity of language and degraded quality when it comes to queries upon object components. In this work, we present FMLGS, an approach that supports part-level open-vocabulary query within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We propose an efficient pipeline for building and querying consistent object- and part-level semantics based on Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). We designed a semantic deviation strategy to solve the problem of language ambiguity among object parts, which interpolates the semantic features of fine-grained targets for enriched information. Once trained, we can query both objects and their describable parts using natural language. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods prove that our method can not only better locate specified part-level targets, but also achieve first-place performance concerning both speed and accuracy, where FMLGS is 98 x faster than LERF, 4 x faster than LangSplat and 2.5 x faster than LEGaussians. Meanwhile, we further integrate FMLGS as a virtual agent that can interactively navigate through 3D scenes, locate targets, and respond to user demands through a chat interface, which demonstrates the potential of our work to be further expanded and applied in the future.",

We have developed a synthetic data pipeline for generating high-quality context-aware instance segmentation training data for specific objects. This process is fully automated, requiring only a video of the target object. We train a Gaussian Splatting model of the target object and automatically extract the object from the video. Leveraging Gaussian Splatting, we then render the object on a random background image, and monocular depth estimation is employed to place the object in a believable pose. We introduce a novel dataset to validate our approach and show superior performance over other data generation approaches, such as Cut-and-Paste and Diffusion model-based generation.",

In contrast to video/4D generation from only text or a single image, our interpolative task can leverage more precise motion control to better constrain the generation. Given two monocular RGB images representing the start and end states of an object in motion, our goal is to generate and reconstruct the motion in 4D, without making assumptions on the object category, motion type, length, or complexity. To handle such arbitrary and diverse motions, we utilize a foundational video interpolation model for motion prediction. However, large frame-to-frame motion gaps can lead to ambiguous interpretations. To this end, we employ a hierarchical approach to identify keyframes that are visually close to the input states while exhibiting significant motions, then generate smooth fragments between them. For each fragment, we construct a 3D representation of the keyframe using Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The temporal frames within the fragment guide the motion, enabling their transformation into dynamic 3DGS through a deformation field. To improve temporal consistency and refine the 3D motion, we expand the self-attention of multi-view diffusion across timesteps and apply rigid transformation regularization. Finally, we merge the independently generated 3D motion segments by interpolating boundary deformation fields and optimizing them to align with the guiding video, ensuring smooth and flicker-free transitions. Through extensive qualitative and quantitive experiments as well as a user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and design choices.",

We present InteracttAvatar, the first model to faithfully capture the photorealistic appearance of dynamic hand and non-rigid hand-face interactions.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become increasingly popular in 3D scene reconstruction for its high visual accuracy. However, uncertainty estimation of 3DGS scenes remains underexplored and is crucial to downstream tasks such as asset extraction and scene completion. Since the appearance of 3D gaussians is view-dependent, the color of a gaussian can thus be certain from an angle and uncertain from another. We thus propose to model uncertainty in 3DGS as an additional view-dependent per-gaussian feature that can be modeled with spherical harmonics. This simple yet effective modeling is easily interpretable and can be integrated into the traditional 3DGS pipeline. It is also significantly faster than ensemble methods while maintaining high accuracy, as demonstrated in our experiments.",

    "abstract": "Automated extraction of plant morphological traits is crucial for supporting crop breeding and agricultural management through high-throughput field phenotyping (HTFP). Solutions based on multi-view RGB images are attractive due to their scalability and affordability, enabling volumetric measurements that 2D approaches cannot directly capture. While advanced methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown promise, their application has been limited to counting or extracting traits from only a few plants or organs. Furthermore, accurately measuring complex structures like individual wheat heads-essential for studying crop yields-remains particularly challenging due to occlusions and the dense arrangement of crop canopies in field conditions. The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising alternative for HTFP due to its high-quality reconstructions and explicit point-based representation. In this paper, we present Wheat3DGS, a novel approach that leverages 3DGS and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise 3D instance segmentation and morphological measurement of hundreds of wheat heads automatically, representing the first application of 3DGS to HTFP. We validate the accuracy of wheat head extraction against high-resolution laser scan data, obtaining per-instance mean absolute percentage errors of 15.1%, 18.3%, and 40.2% for length, width, and volume. We provide additional comparisons to NeRF-based approaches and traditional Muti-View Stereo (MVS), demonstrating superior results. Our approach enables rapid, non-destructive measurements of key yield-related traits at scale, with significant implications for accelerating crop breeding and improving our understanding of wheat development.",

Unlike prior methods that rely on task-specific networks and assumptions about movable parts, our IAAO leverages large foundation models to estimate interactive affordances and part articulations in three stages. We first build hierarchical features and label fields for each object state using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by distilling mask features and view-consistent labels from multi-view images. We then perform object- and part-level queries on the 3D Gaussian primitives to identify static and articulated elements, estimating global transformations and local articulation parameters along with affordances. Finally, scenes from different states are merged and refined based on the estimated transformations, enabling robust affordance-based interaction and manipulation of objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D assets from images, known as inverse rendering (IR), remains a challenging task due to its ill-posed nature. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities for novel view synthesis (NVS) tasks. Methods apply it to relighting by separating radiance into BRDF parameters and lighting, yet produce inferior relighting quality with artifacts and unnatural indirect illumination due to the limited capability of each Gaussian, which has constant material parameters and normal, alongside the absence of physical constraints for indirect lighting. In this paper, we present a novel framework called Spatially-vayring Gaussian Inverse Rendering (SVG-IR), aimed at enhancing both NVS and relighting quality. To this end, we propose a new representation-Spatially-varying Gaussian (SVG)-that allows per-Gaussian spatially varying parameters. This enhanced representation is complemented by a SVG splatting scheme akin to vertex/fragment shading in traditional graphics pipelines. Furthermore, we integrate a physically-based indirect lighting model, enabling more realistic relighting. The proposed SVG-IR framework significantly improves rendering quality, outperforming state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods by 2.5 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and surpassing existing Gaussian-based techniques by 3.5 dB in relighting tasks, all while maintaining a real-time rendering speed.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting (GS) is a popular approach for 3D reconstruction, mostly due to its ability to converge reasonably fast, faithfully represent the scene and render (novel) views in a fast fashion. However, it suffers from large storage and memory requirements, and its training speed still lags behind the hash-grid based radiance field approaches (e.g. Instant-NGP), which makes it especially difficult to deploy them in robotics scenarios, where 3D reconstruction is crucial for accurate operation. In this paper, we propose GSta that dynamically identifies Gaussians that have converged well during training, based on their positional and color gradient norms. By forcing such Gaussians into a siesta and stopping their updates (freezing) during training, we improve training speed with competitive accuracy compared to state of the art. We also propose an early stopping mechanism based on the PSNR values computed on a subset of training images. Combined with other improvements, such as integrating a learning rate scheduler, GSta achieves an improved Pareto front in convergence speed, memory and storage requirements, while preserving quality. We also show that GSta can improve other methods and complement orthogonal approaches in efficiency improvement; once combined with Trick-GS, GSta achieves up to 5x faster training, 16x smaller disk size compared to vanilla GS, while having comparable accuracy and consuming only half the peak memory.

We evaluate the resulting pipeline in realworld experiments under velocity commands that bring the robot on an intercept course with obstacles.

It delivers realistic and detailed results through a collection of explicit 3D Gaussian primitives, each carrying opacity and view-dependent color. However, efficient rendering of many transparent primitives remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches either rasterize the Gaussians with approximate per-view sorting or rely on high-end RTX GPUs. This paper proposes a stochastic ray-tracing method to render 3D clouds of transparent primitives. Instead of processing all ray-Gaussian intersections in sequential order, each ray traverses the acceleration structure only once, randomly accepting and shading a single intersection (or $N$ intersections, using a simple extension). This approach minimizes shading time and avoids primitive sorting along the ray, thereby minimizing register usage and maximizing parallelism even on low-end GPUs. The cost of rays through the Gaussian asset is comparable to that of standard mesh-intersection rays. The shading is unbiased and has low variance, as our stochastic acceptance achieves importance sampling based on accumulated weight. The alignment with Monte Carlo philosophy simplifies implementation and integration into a conventional path-tracing framework.",

We present Micro-Splatting: Two-Stage Adaptive Growth and Refinement, a unified, in-training pipeline that preserves visual detail while drastically reducing model complexity without any post-processing or auxiliary neural modules. In Stage I (Growth), we introduce a trace-based covariance regularization to maintain near-isotropic Gaussians, mitigating low-pass filtering in high-frequency regions and improving spherical-harmonic color fitting. We then apply gradient-guided adaptive densification that subdivides splats only in visually complex regions, leaving smooth areas sparse. In Stage II (Refinement), we prune low-impact splats using a simple opacity-scale importance score and merge redundant neighbors via lightweight spatial and feature thresholds, producing a lean yet detail-rich model. On four object-centric benchmarks, Micro-Splatting reduces splat count and model size by up to 60% and shortens training by 20%, while matching or surpassing state-of-the-art PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS in real-time rendering. These results demonstrate that Micro-Splatting delivers both compactness and high fidelity in a single, efficient, end-to-end framework.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method for authoring non-realistic 3D objects (represented as either 3D Gaussian Splats or meshes), that comply with 2D edits from specific viewpoints. Namely, given a 3D object, a user chooses different viewpoints and interactively deforms the object in the 2D image plane of each view. The method then produces a \"deformation field\" - an interpolation between those 2D deformations in a smooth manner as the viewpoint changes. Our core observation is that the 2D deformations do not need to be tied to an underlying object, nor share the same deformation space. We use this observation to devise a method for authoring view-dependent deformations, holding several technical contributions: first, a novel way to compositionality-blend between the 2D deformations after lifting them to 3D - this enables the user to \"stack\" the deformations similarly to layers in an editing software, each deformation operating on the results of the previous; second, a novel method to apply the 3D deformation to 3D Gaussian Splats; third, an approach to author the 2D deformations, by deforming a 2D mesh encapsulating a rendered image of the object. We show the versatility and efficacy of our method by adding cartoonish effects to objects, providing means to modify human characters, fitting 3D models to given 2D sketches and caricatures, resolving occlusions, and recreating classic non-realistic paintings as 3D models.",

We follow a three-stage process: we first map static 3D Gaussians to a particle-based representation. We then introduce dynamic particles and simulate their motion using the Material Point Method (MPM). Finally, we map the simulated particles back to the Gaussian domain while introducing appearance parameters tailored for specific effects. To correctly handle the interactions of dynamic elements with the static scene, we introduce specialized collision handling techniques. Our approach supports a variety of weather effects, including snowfall, rainfall, fog, and sandstorms, and can also support falling objects, all with physically plausible motion and appearance.

However, current methods often generate low-quality textures and inconsistent 3D structures. This is especially true when extrapolating significantly beyond the field of view of the reference image. To address these challenges, we propose PanoDreamer, a novel framework for consistent, 3D scene generation with flexible text and image control. Our approach employs a large language model and a warp-refine pipeline, first generating an initial set of images and then compositing them into a 360-degree panorama. This panorama is then lifted into 3D to form an initial point cloud. We then use several approaches to generate additional images, from different viewpoints, that are consistent with the initial point cloud and expand/refine the initial point cloud. Given the resulting set of images, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to create the final 3D scene, which can then be rendered from different viewpoints. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PanoDreamer in generating high-quality, geometrically consistent 3D scenes.",

And the approaches and advantages of memory-efficient data formats and storage techniques for such datasets vary. OpenVDB library and its VDB data format excels in memory efficiency through its hierarchical and dynamic tree structure, with active and inactive sub-trees for data storage. It is heavily used in current production renderers for both animation and rendering stages in VFX pipelines and photorealistic rendering of volumes and fluids. However, it still remains to be fully leveraged in SciVis where domains dealing with sparse scalar fields like porous media, time varying volumes such as tornado and weather simulation or high resolution simulation of Computational Fluid Dynamics present ample number of large challenging data sets. The goal of this paper hence is not only to explore the use of OpenVDB in SciVis but also to explore a level of detail(LOD) technique using 3D Gaussian particles approximating voxel regions. For rendering, we utilize NVIDIA OptiX library for ray marching through the Gaussians particles. Data modeling using 3D Gaussians has been very popular lately due to success in stereoscopic image to 3D scene conversion using Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian approximation and mixture models aren't entirely new in SciVis as well. Our work explores the integration with rendering software libraries like OpenVDB and OptiX to take advantage of their built-in memory compaction and hardware acceleration features, while also leveraging the performance capabilities of modern GPUs. Thus, we present a SciVis rendering approach that uses 3D Gaussians at varying LOD in a lossy scheme derived from VDB datasets, rather than focusing on photorealistic volume rendering.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology has recently achieved photorealistic mapping capabilities thanks to the real-time, high-fidelity rendering enabled by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, due to the static representation of scenes, current 3DGS-based SLAM encounters issues with pose drift and failure to reconstruct accurate maps in dynamic environments. To address this problem, we present D4DGS-SLAM, the first SLAM method based on 4DGS map representation for dynamic environments. By incorporating the temporal dimension into scene representation, D4DGS-SLAM enables high-quality reconstruction of dynamic scenes. Utilizing the dynamics-aware InfoModule, we can obtain the dynamics, visibility, and reliability of scene points, and filter out unstable dynamic points for tracking accordingly. When optimizing Gaussian points, we apply different isotropic regularization terms to Gaussians with varying dynamic characteristics. Experimental results on real-world dynamic scene datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both camera pose tracking and map quality.",

    "abstract": "Recent novel view synthesis (NVS) techniques, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly advanced 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality rendering and realistic detail recovery. Effectively removing occlusions while preserving scene details can further enhance the robustness and applicability of these techniques. However, existing approaches for object and occlusion removal predominantly rely on generative priors, which, despite filling the resulting holes, introduce new artifacts and blurriness. Moreover, existing benchmark datasets for evaluating occlusion removal methods lack realistic complexity and viewpoint variations. To address these issues, we introduce DeclutterSet, a novel dataset featuring diverse scenes with pronounced occlusions distributed across foreground, midground, and background, exhibiting substantial relative motion across viewpoints. We further introduce DeclutterNeRF, an occlusion removal method free from generative priors. DeclutterNeRF introduces joint multi-view optimization of learnable camera parameters, occlusion annealing regularization, and employs an explainable stochastic structural similarity loss, ensuring high-quality, artifact-free reconstructions from incomplete images. Experiments demonstrate that DeclutterNeRF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on our proposed DeclutterSet, establishing a strong baseline for future research.",

    "abstract": "Tool use is essential for enabling robots to perform complex real-world tasks, but learning such skills requires extensive datasets. While teleoperation is widely used, it is slow, delay-sensitive, and poorly suited for dynamic tasks. In contrast, human videos provide a natural way for data collection without specialized hardware, though they pose challenges on robot learning due to viewpoint variations and embodiment gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that transfers tool-use knowledge from humans to robots. To improve the policy's robustness to viewpoint variations, we use two RGB cameras to reconstruct 3D scenes and apply Gaussian splatting for novel view synthesis. We reduce the embodiment gap using segmented observations and tool-centric, task-space actions to achieve embodiment-invariant visuomotor policy learning. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness across a diverse suite of tool-use tasks, where our learned policy shows strong generalization and robustness to human perturbations, camera motion, and robot base movement. Our method achieves a 71\\% improvement in task success over teleoperation-based diffusion policies and dramatically reduces data collection time by 77\\% and 41\\% compared to teleoperation and the state-of-the-art interface, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In the European Union, buildings account for 42% of energy use and 35% of greenhouse gas emissions. Since most existing buildings will still be in use by 2050, retrofitting is crucial for emissions reduction. However, current building assessment methods rely mainly on qualitative thermal imaging, which limits data-driven decisions for energy savings. On the other hand, quantitative assessments using finite element analysis (FEA) offer precise insights but require manual CAD design, which is tedious and error-prone. Recent advances in 3D reconstruction, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, enable precise 3D modeling from sparse images but lack clearly defined volumes and the interfaces between them needed for FEA. We propose Thermoxels, a novel voxel-based method able to generate FEA-compatible models, including both geometry and temperature, from a sparse set of RGB and thermal images. Using pairs of RGB and thermal images as input, Thermoxels represents a scene's geometry as a set of voxels comprising color and temperature information. After optimization, a simple process is used to transform Thermoxels' models into tetrahedral meshes compatible with FEA. We demonstrate Thermoxels' capability to generate RGB+Thermal meshes of 3D scenes, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods. To showcase the practical applications of Thermoxels' models, we conduct a simple heat conduction simulation using FEA, achieving convergence from an initial state defined by Thermoxels' thermal reconstruction. Additionally, we compare Thermoxels' image synthesis abilities with current state-of-the-art methods, showing competitive results, and discuss the limitations of existing metrics in assessing mesh quality.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized neural rendering with its efficiency and quality, but like many novel view synthesis methods, it heavily depends on accurate camera poses from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems. Although recent SfM pipelines have made impressive progress, questions remain about how to further improve both their robust performance in challenging conditions (e.g., textureless scenes) and the precision of camera parameter estimation simultaneously. We present 3R-GS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges this gap by jointly optimizing 3D Gaussians and camera parameters from large reconstruction priors MASt3R-SfM. We note that naively performing joint 3D Gaussian and camera optimization faces two challenges: the sensitivity to the quality of SfM initialization, and its limited capacity for global optimization, leading to suboptimal reconstruction results. Our 3R-GS, overcomes these issues by incorporating optimized practices, enabling robust scene reconstruction even with imperfect camera registration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3R-GS delivers high-quality novel view synthesis and precise camera pose estimation while remaining computationally efficient.

To address it, we propose an interpretable single-view 3DGS framework, termed 3DisGS, to discover both coarse- and fine-grained 3D semantics via hierarchical disentangled representation learning (DRL). Specifically, the model employs a dual-branch architecture, consisting of a point cloud initialization branch and a triplane-Gaussian generation branch, to achieve coarse-grained disentanglement by separating 3D geometry and visual appearance features. Subsequently, fine-grained semantic representations within each modality are further discovered through DRL-based encoder-adapters. To our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve unsupervised interpretable 3DGS. Evaluations indicate that our model achieves 3D disentanglement while preserving high-quality and rapid reconstruction.",

Current approaches rely on generative models to synthesize multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction and animation. However, directly generating multiple views from a single human image suffers from geometric inconsistencies, resulting in issues like fragmented or blurred limbs in the reconstructed models. To tackle these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{HumanDreamer-X}, a novel framework that integrates multi-view human generation and reconstruction into a unified pipeline, which significantly enhances the geometric consistency and visual fidelity of the reconstructed 3D models. In this framework, 3D Gaussian Splatting serves as an explicit 3D representation to provide initial geometry and appearance priority. Building upon this foundation, \\textbf{HumanFixer} is trained to restore 3DGS renderings, which guarantee photorealistic results. Furthermore, we delve into the inherent challenges associated with attention mechanisms in multi-view human generation, and propose an attention modulation strategy that effectively enhances geometric details identity consistency across multi-view. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach markedly improves generation and reconstruction PSNR quality metrics by 16.45% and 12.65%, respectively, achieving a PSNR of up to 25.62 dB, while also showing generalization capabilities on in-the-wild data and applicability to various human reconstruction backbone models.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in 3D reconstruction, achieving high-quality results with real-time radiance field rendering. However, a key challenge is the substantial storage cost: reconstructing a single scene typically requires millions of Gaussian splats, each represented by 59 floating-point parameters, resulting in approximately 1 GB of memory. To address this challenge, we propose a compression method by building separate attribute codebooks and storing only discrete code indices. Specifically, we employ noise-substituted vector quantization technique to jointly train the codebooks and model features, ensuring consistency between gradient descent optimization and parameter discretization. Our method reduces the memory consumption efficiently (around $45\\times$) while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality on standard 3D benchmark scenes. Experiments on different codebook sizes show the trade-off between compression ratio and image quality. Furthermore, the trained compressed model remains fully compatible with popular 3DGS viewers and enables faster rendering speed, making it well-suited for practical applications.",

To address this fundamental challenge, we propose ConsDreamer, a novel framework that mitigates view bias by refining both the conditional and unconditional terms in the score distillation process: (1) a View Disentanglement Module (VDM) that eliminates viewpoint biases in conditional prompts by decoupling irrelevant view components and injecting precise camera parameters; and (2) a similarity-based partial order loss that enforces geometric consistency in the unconditional term by aligning cosine similarities with azimuth relationships.

Experiments demonstrate that our panoramic video generation model, trained with a mix of image and video data, achieves convincing spatial and temporal consistency for static scenes. This is validated by an average COLMAP matching rate of 94.6\\%, allowing for high-quality panoramic Gaussian splat reconstruction and improved navigation throughout the scene.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved impressive results in real-time 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, these methods struggle in large-scale, unconstrained environments where sparse and uneven input coverage, transient occlusions, appearance variability, and inconsistent camera settings lead to degraded quality. We propose GS-Diff, a novel 3DGS framework guided by a multi-view diffusion model to address these limitations. By generating pseudo-observations conditioned on multi-view inputs, our method transforms under-constrained 3D reconstruction problems into well-posed ones, enabling robust optimization even with sparse data. GS-Diff further integrates several enhancements, including appearance embedding, monocular depth priors, dynamic object modeling, anisotropy regularization, and advanced rasterization techniques, to tackle geometric and photometric challenges in real-world settings. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that GS-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins.",

To address this, we introduce a fisheye image dataset tailored for scene reconstruction tasks. Using dual 200-degree fisheye lenses, our dataset provides full 360-degree coverage of 5 indoor and 5 outdoor scenes.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting enables high-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) at real-time frame rates. However, its quality drops sharply as we depart from the training views. Thus, dense captures are needed to match the high-quality expectations of applications like Virtual Reality (VR). However, such dense captures are very laborious and expensive to obtain. Existing works have explored using 2D generative models to alleviate this requirement by distillation or generating additional training views. These models typically rely on a noise-to-data generative process conditioned only on a handful of reference input views, leading to hallucinations, inconsistent generation results, and subsequent reconstruction artifacts. Instead, we propose a multi-view, flow matching model that learns a flow to directly connect novel view renderings from possibly sparse reconstructions to renderings that we expect from dense reconstructions. This enables augmenting scene captures with consistent, generated views to improve reconstruction quality. Our model is trained on a novel dataset of 3.6M image pairs and can process up to 45 views at 540x960 resolution (91K tokens) on one H100 GPU in a single forward pass. Our pipeline consistently improves NVS in sparse- and dense-view scenarios, leading to higher-quality reconstructions than prior works across multiple, widely-used NVS benchmarks.",

They learn 3D Gaussians from 2D RGB images generated from pre-trained multi-view diffusion (MVD) models, and have shown a promising avenue for 3D generation through a single image. Despite the current progress, these methods still suffer from the inconsistency jointly caused by the geometric ambiguity in the 2D images, and the lack of structure of 3D Gaussians, leading to distorted and blurry 3D object generation. In this paper, we propose to fix these issues by GS-RGBN, a new RGBN-volume Gaussian Reconstruction Model designed to generate high-fidelity 3D objects from single-view images. Our key insight is a structured 3D representation can simultaneously mitigate the afore-mentioned two issues. To this end, we propose a novel hybrid Voxel-Gaussian representation, where a 3D voxel representation contains explicit 3D geometric information, eliminating the geometric ambiguity from 2D images. It also structures Gaussians during learning so that the optimization tends to find better local optima. Our 3D voxel representation is obtained by a fusion module that aligns RGB features and surface normal features, both of which can be estimated from 2D images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our methods over prior works in terms of high-quality reconstruction results, robust generalization, and good efficiency.",

Such lighting degradations and view-dependent variations pose substantial challenges to novel view synthesis (NVS) frameworks based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). To address this, we introduce Luminance-GS, a novel approach to achieving high-quality novel view synthesis results under diverse challenging lighting conditions using 3DGS. By adopting per-view color matrix mapping and view-adaptive curve adjustments, Luminance-GS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various lighting conditions -- including low-light, overexposure, and varying exposure -- while not altering the original 3DGS explicit representation.

Although recent inverse rendering approaches aim to decompose scenes into material and lighting components, they often rely on simplifying assumptions that fail when editing. We present a novel approach that enables efficient global illumination for 3D Gaussians Splatting through screen-space ray tracing. Our key insight is that a substantial amount of indirect light can be traced back to surfaces visible within the current view frustum. Leveraging this observation, we augment the direct shading computed by 3D Gaussians with Monte-Carlo screen-space ray-tracing to capture one-bounce indirect illumination. In this way, our method enables realistic global illumination without sacrificing the computational efficiency and editability benefits of 3D Gaussians. Through experiments, we show that the screen-space approximation we utilize allows for indirect illumination and supports real-time rendering and editing.

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has gained considerable attentions in the field of novel view synthesis due to its fast performance while yielding the excellent image quality. However, 3DGS in sparse-view settings (e.g., three-view inputs) often faces with the problem of overfitting to training views, which significantly drops the visual quality of novel view images. Many existing approaches have tackled this issue by using strong priors, such as 2D generative contextual information and external depth signals. In contrast, this paper introduces a prior-free method, so-called DropGaussian, with simple changes in 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we randomly remove Gaussians during the training process in a similar way of dropout, which allows non-excluded Gaussians to have larger gradients while improving their visibility. This makes the remaining Gaussians to contribute more to the optimization process for rendering with sparse input views. Such simple operation effectively alleviates the overfitting problem and enhances the quality of novel view synthesis. By simply applying DropGaussian to the original 3DGS framework, we can achieve the competitive performance with existing prior-based 3DGS methods in sparse-view settings of benchmark datasets without any additional complexity.

However, in the absence of multi-view and personalized training data, the incompleteness of geometric and appearance information poses a significant challenge. To address these challenges, MGGTalk explores depth information to enhance geometric and facial symmetry characteristics to supplement both geometric and appearance features. Initially, based on the pixel-wise geometric information obtained from depth estimation, we incorporate symmetry operations and point cloud filtering techniques to ensure a complete and precise position parameter for 3DGS. Subsequently, we adopt a two-stage strategy with symmetric priors for predicting the remaining 3DGS parameters. We begin by predicting Gaussian parameters for the visible facial regions of the source image. These parameters are subsequently utilized to improve the prediction of Gaussian parameters for the non-visible regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGGTalk surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance across various metrics.",

Recognizing that 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) can reconstruct geometric information from camera image sequences, we propose a calibration method that estimates LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameters using geometric constraints. The proposed method begins by reconstructing colorless 2DGS using LiDAR point clouds. Subsequently, we update the colors of the Gaussian splats by minimizing the photometric loss. The extrinsic parameters are optimized during this process. Additionally, we address the limitations of the photometric loss by incorporating the reprojection and triangulation losses, thereby enhancing the calibration robustness and accuracy.",

DD3G compresses and integrates extensive visual and spatial geometric knowledge from the MV-DM by simulating its ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory, ensuring the distilled generator generalizes better than those trained solely on 3D data. Unlike previous amortized optimization approaches, we align the MV-DM and 3D generator representation spaces to transfer the teacher's probabilistic flow to the student, thus avoiding inconsistencies in optimization objectives caused by probabilistic sampling. The introduction of probabilistic flow and the coupling of various attributes in 3D Gaussians introduce challenges in the generation process. To tackle this, we propose PEPD, a generator consisting of Pattern Extraction and Progressive Decoding phases, which enables efficient fusion of probabilistic flow and converts a single image into 3D Gaussians within 0.06 seconds. Furthermore, to reduce knowledge loss and overcome sparse-view supervision, we design a joint optimization objective that ensures the quality of generated samples through explicit supervision and implicit verification. Leveraging existing 2D generation models, we compile 120k high-quality RGBA images for distillation. Experiments on synthetic and public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of immersive and realistic 3D scenes holds significant practical importance in various fields of computer vision and computer graphics. Typically, immersive and realistic scenes should be free from obstructions by dynamic objects, maintain global texture consistency, and allow for unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven scene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a moving virtual camera to generate the scene. However, previous methods struggle with visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying camera poses, and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by foreground-background occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel layered 3D scene reconstruction framework from panoramic image, named Scene4U. Specifically, Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a large language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then, we employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded regions using visual cues and depth information, generating a hierarchical representation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation, followed by layered optimization, which ultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural consistency that supports free exploration. Scene4U outperforms state-of-the-art method, improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE, while also achieving the fastest training speed. Additionally, to demonstrate the robustness of Scene4U and allow users to experience immersive scenes from various landmarks, we build WorldVista3D dataset for 3D scene reconstruction, which contains panoramic images of globally renowned sites. The implementation code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/Scene4U .",

    "abstract": "Directly employing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) on images with adverse illumination conditions exhibits considerable difficulty in achieving high-quality, normally-exposed representations due to: (1) The limited Structure from Motion (SfM) points estimated in adverse illumination scenarios fail to capture sufficient scene details; (2) Without ground-truth references, the intensive information loss, significant noise, and color distortion pose substantial challenges for 3DGS to produce high-quality results; (3) Combining existing exposure correction methods with 3DGS does not achieve satisfactory performance due to their individual enhancement processes, which lead to the illumination inconsistency between enhanced images from different viewpoints. To address these issues, we propose LITA-GS, a novel illumination-agnostic novel view synthesis method via reference-free 3DGS and physical priors. Firstly, we introduce an illumination-invariant physical prior extraction pipeline. Secondly, based on the extracted robust spatial structure prior, we develop the lighting-agnostic structure rendering strategy, which facilitates the optimization of the scene structure and object appearance. Moreover, a progressive denoising module is introduced to effectively mitigate the noise within the light-invariant representation. We adopt the unsupervised strategy for the training of LITA-GS and extensive experiments demonstrate that LITA-GS surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) NeRF-based method while enjoying faster inference speed and costing reduced training time.

We propose ERUPT (Efficient Rendering with Unposed Patch Transformer) a state-of-the-art scene reconstruction model capable of efficient scene rendering using unposed imagery. We introduce patch-based querying, in contrast to existing pixel-based queries, to reduce the compute required to render a target view. This makes our model highly efficient both during training and at inference, capable of rendering at 600 fps on commercial hardware. Notably, our model is designed to use a learned latent camera pose which allows for training using unposed targets in datasets with sparse or inaccurate ground truth camera pose. We show that our approach can generalize on large real-world data and introduce a new benchmark dataset (MSVS-1M) for latent view synthesis using street-view imagery collected from Mapillary. In contrast to NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, which require dense imagery and precise metadata, ERUPT can render novel views of arbitrary scenes with as few as five unposed input images. ERUPT achieves better rendered image quality than current state-of-the-art methods for unposed image synthesis tasks, reduces labeled data requirements by ~95\\% and decreases computational requirements by an order of magnitude, providing efficient novel view synthesis for diverse real-world scenes.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a popular radiance field method, with many application-specific extensions. Most variants rely on the same core algorithm: depth-sorting of Gaussian splats then rasterizing in primitive order. This ensures correct alpha compositing, but can cause rendering artifacts due to built-in approximations. Moreover, for a fixed representation, sorted rendering offers little control over render cost and visual fidelity. For example, and counter-intuitively, rendering a lower-resolution image is not necessarily faster. In this work, we address the above limitations by combining 3D Gaussian splatting with stochastic rasterization. Concretely, we leverage an unbiased Monte Carlo estimator of the volume rendering equation. This removes the need for sorting, and allows for accurate 3D blending of overlapping Gaussians. The number of Monte Carlo samples further imbues 3DGS with a way to trade off computation time and quality. We implement our method using OpenGL shaders, enabling efficient rendering on modern GPU hardware. At a reasonable visual quality, our method renders more than four times faster than sorted rasterization.",

Inspired by this intuition, we propose Visual Acoustic Fields, a framework that bridges hitting sounds and visual signals within a 3D space using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach features two key modules: sound generation and sound localization. The sound generation module leverages a conditional diffusion model, which takes multiscale features rendered from a feature-augmented 3DGS to generate realistic hitting sounds. Meanwhile, the sound localization module enables querying the 3D scene, represented by the feature-augmented 3DGS, to localize hitting positions based on the sound sources. To support this framework, we introduce a novel pipeline for collecting scene-level visual-sound sample pairs, achieving alignment between captured images, impact locations, and corresponding sounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to connect visual and acoustic signals in a 3D context. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Visual Acoustic Fields in generating plausible impact sounds and accurately localizing impact sources.

    "abstract": "Realistic simulation is critical for applications ranging from robotics to animation. Learned simulators have emerged as a possibility to capture real world physics directly from video data, but very often require privileged information such as depth information, particle tracks and hand-engineered features to maintain spatial and temporal consistency. These strong inductive biases or ground truth 3D information help in domains where data is sparse but limit scalability and generalization in data rich regimes. To overcome the key limitations, we propose 3DGSim, a learned 3D simulator that directly learns physical interactions from multi-view RGB videos. 3DGSim unifies 3D scene reconstruction, particle dynamics prediction and video synthesis into an end-to-end trained framework. It adopts MVSplat to learn a latent particle-based representation of 3D scenes, a Point Transformer for particle dynamics, a Temporal Merging module for consistent temporal aggregation and Gaussian Splatting to produce novel view renderings. By jointly training inverse rendering and dynamics forecasting, 3DGSim embeds the physical properties into point-wise latent features. This enables the model to capture diverse physical behaviors, from rigid to elastic, cloth-like dynamics, and boundary conditions (e.g. fixed cloth corner), along with realistic lighting effects that also generalize to unseen multibody interactions and novel scene edits.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for augmented and virtual reality applications has highlighted the importance of crafting immersive 3D scenes from a simple single-view image. However, due to the partial priors provided by single-view input, existing methods are often limited to reconstruct low-consistency 3D scenes with narrow fields of view from single-view input. These limitations make them less capable of generalizing to reconstruct immersive scenes. To address this problem, we propose ExScene, a two-stage pipeline to reconstruct an immersive 3D scene from any given single-view image. ExScene designs a novel multimodal diffusion model to generate a high-fidelity and globally consistent panoramic image. We then develop a panoramic depth estimation approach to calculate geometric information from panorama, and we combine geometric information with high-fidelity panoramic image to train an initial 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. Following this, we introduce a GS refinement technique with 2D stable video diffusion priors. We add camera trajectory consistency and color-geometric priors into the denoising process of diffusion to improve color and spatial consistency across image sequences. These refined sequences are then used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model, leading to better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our ExScene achieves consistent and immersive scene reconstruction using only single-view input, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.",

However, despite its effectiveness on high-end GPUs, it struggles on edge systems like the Jetson Orin NX Edge GPU, achieving only 7-17 FPS -- well below the over 60 FPS standard required for truly immersive AR/VR experiences. Addressing this challenge, we perform a comprehensive analysis of Gaussian-based AR/VR applications and identify the Gaussian Blending Stage, which intensively calculates each Gaussian's contribution at every pixel, as the primary bottleneck. In response, we propose a Gaussian Blending Unit (GBU), an edge GPU plug-in module for real-time rendering in AR/VR applications. Notably, our GBU can be seamlessly integrated into conventional edge GPUs and collaboratively supports a wide range of AR/VR applications. Specifically, GBU incorporates an intra-row sequential shading (IRSS) dataflow that shades each row of pixels sequentially from left to right, utilizing a two-step coordinate transformation. When directly deployed on a GPU, the proposed dataflow achieved a non-trivial 1.72x speedup on real-world static scenes, though still falls short of real-time rendering performance. Recognizing the limited compute utilization in the GPU-based implementation, GBU enhances rendering speed with a dedicated rendering engine that balances the workload across rows by aggregating computations from multiple Gaussians. Experiments across representative AR/VR applications demonstrate that our GBU provides a unified solution for on-device real-time rendering while maintaining SOTA rendering quality.",

In this work, we propose ReasonGrounder, an LVLM-guided framework that uses hierarchical 3D feature Gaussian fields for adaptive grouping based on physical scale, enabling open-vocabulary 3D grounding and reasoning. ReasonGrounder interprets implicit instructions using large vision-language models (LVLM) and localizes occluded objects through 3D Gaussian splatting. By incorporating 2D segmentation masks from the SAM and multi-view CLIP embeddings, ReasonGrounder selects Gaussian groups based on object scale, enabling accurate localization through both explicit and implicit language understanding, even in novel, occluded views. We also contribute ReasoningGD, a new dataset containing over 10K scenes and 2 million annotations for evaluating open-vocabulary 3D grounding and amodal perception under occlusion.

Our observation is that neural fields like NeRF can represent complex 3D scenes with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using only a few megabytes. Thus, NeuralGS effectively adopts the neural field representation to encode the attributes of 3D Gaussians with MLPs, only requiring a small storage size even for a large-scale scene. To achieve this, we adopt a clustering strategy and fit the Gaussians within each cluster using different tiny MLPs, based on importance scores of Gaussians as fitting weights.

As an early attempt, CityGS-X abandons the cumbersome merge-and-partition process and instead adopts a newly-designed batch-level multi-task rendering process. This architecture enables efficient multi-GPU rendering through dynamic Level-of-Detail voxel allocations, significantly improving scalability and performance. Through extensive experiments, CityGS-X consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of faster training times, larger rendering capacities, and more accurate geometric details in large-scale scenes. Notably, CityGS-X can train and render a scene with 5,000+ images in just 5 hours using only 4 * 4090 GPUs, a task that would make other alternative methods encounter Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issues and fail completely. This implies that CityGS-X is far beyond the capacity of other existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the integration of the efficient feed-forward scheme into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has been actively explored. However, most existing methods focus on sparse view reconstruction of small regions and cannot produce eligible whole-scene reconstruction results in terms of either quality or efficiency. In this paper, we propose FreeSplat++, which focuses on extending the generalizable 3DGS to become an alternative approach to large-scale indoor whole-scene reconstruction, which has the potential of significantly accelerating the reconstruction speed and improving the geometric accuracy. To facilitate whole-scene reconstruction, we initially propose the Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation framework to efficiently process extremely long input sequences. Subsequently, we introduce a carefully designed pixel-wise triplet fusion method to incrementally aggregate the overlapping 3D Gaussian primitives from multiple views, adaptively reducing their redundancy. Furthermore, we propose a weighted floater removal strategy that can effectively reduce floaters, which serves as an explicit depth fusion approach that is crucial in whole-scene reconstruction. After the feed-forward reconstruction of 3DGS primitives, we investigate a depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning process. Leveraging the dense, multi-view consistent depth maps obtained during the feed-forward prediction phase for an extra constraint, we refine the entire scene's 3DGS primitive to enhance rendering quality while preserving geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments confirm that our FreeSplat++ significantly outperforms existing generalizable 3DGS methods, especially in whole-scene reconstructions. Compared to conventional per-scene optimized 3DGS approaches, our method with depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in reconstruction accuracy and a notable reduction in training time.",

Hands-on aerial robotics courses are pivotal in training the next-generation workforce to meet the growing market demands. Such an efficient and compelling course depends on a reliable testbed. In this paper, we present VizFlyt, an open-source perception-centric Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) photorealistic testing framework for aerial robotics courses. We utilize pose from an external localization system to hallucinate real-time and photorealistic visual sensors using 3D Gaussian Splatting. This enables stress-free testing of autonomy algorithms on aerial robots without the risk of crashing into obstacles. We achieve over 100Hz of system update rate. Lastly, we build upon our past experiences of offering hands-on aerial robotics courses and propose a new open-source and open-hardware curriculum based on VizFlyt for the future. We test our framework on various course projects in real-world HITL experiments and present the results showing the efficacy of such a system and its large potential use cases.

    "abstract": "We present TranSplat, a 3D scene rendering algorithm that enables realistic cross-scene object transfer (from a source to a target scene) based on the Gaussian Splatting framework. Our approach addresses two critical challenges: (1) precise 3D object extraction from the source scene, and (2) faithful relighting of the transferred object in the target scene without explicit material property estimation. TranSplat fits a splatting model to the source scene, using 2D object masks to drive fine-grained 3D segmentation. Following user-guided insertion of the object into the target scene, along with automatic refinement of position and orientation, TranSplat derives per-Gaussian radiance transfer functions via spherical harmonic analysis to adapt the object's appearance to match the target scene's lighting environment. This relighting strategy does not require explicitly estimating physical scene properties such as BRDFs. Evaluated on several synthetic and real-world scenes and objects, TranSplat yields excellent 3D object extractions and relighting performance compared to recent baseline methods and visually convincing cross-scene object transfers. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the approach.",

    "abstract": "Talking head synthesis has emerged as a prominent research topic in computer graphics and multimedia, yet most existing methods often struggle to strike a balance between generation quality and computational efficiency, particularly under real-time constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates Gaussian Splatting with a structured Audio Factorization Plane (Audio-Plane) to enable high-quality, audio-synchronized, and real-time talking head generation. For modeling a dynamic talking head, a 4D volume representation, which consists of three axes in 3D space and one temporal axis aligned with audio progression, is typically required. However, directly storing and processing a dense 4D grid is impractical due to the high memory and computation cost, and lack of scalability for longer durations. We address this challenge by decomposing the 4D volume representation into a set of audio-independent spatial planes and audio-dependent planes, forming a compact and interpretable representation for talking head modeling that we refer to as the Audio-Plane. This factorized design allows for efficient and fine-grained audio-aware spatial encoding, and significantly enhances the model's ability to capture complex lip dynamics driven by speech signals. To further improve region-specific motion modeling, we introduce an audio-guided saliency splatting mechanism based on region-aware modulation, which adaptively emphasizes highly dynamic regions such as the mouth area. This allows the model to focus its learning capacity on where it matters most for accurate speech-driven animation. Extensive experiments on both the self-driven and the cross-driven settings demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual quality, precise audio-lip synchronization, and real-time performance, outperforming prior approaches across both 2D- and 3D-based paradigms.",

To address these issues we propose EndoLRMGS, that combines Large Reconstruction Modelling (LRM) and Gaussian Splatting (GS), for complete surgical scene reconstruction. GS reconstructs deformable tissues and LRM generates 3D models for surgical tools while position and scale are subsequently optimized by introducing orthogonal perspective joint projection optimization (OPjPO) to enhance accuracy. In experiments on four surgical videos from three public datasets, our method improves the Intersection-over-union (IoU) of tool 3D models in 2D projections by>40%. Additionally, EndoLRMGS improves the PSNR of the tools projection from 3.82% to 11.07%. Tissue rendering quality also improves, with PSNR increasing from 0.46% to 49.87%, and SSIM from 1.53% to 29.21% across all test videos.",

Although Scaffold-GS achieves higher quality real-time rendering compared to the original 3D-GS, its fine-grained rendering of the scene is extremely dependent on adequate viewing angles. The spectral bias of neural network learning results in Scaffold-GS's poor ability to perceive and learn high-frequency information in the scene. In this work, we propose enhancing the manifold complexity of input features and using network-based feature map loss to improve the image reconstruction quality of 3D-GS models. We introduce AH-GS, which enables 3D Gaussians in structurally complex regions to obtain higher-frequency encodings, allowing the model to more effectively learn the high-frequency information of the scene. Additionally, we incorporate high-frequency reinforce loss to further enhance the model's ability to capture detailed frequency information. Our result demonstrates that our model significantly improves rendering fidelity, and in specific scenarios (e.g., MipNeRf360-garden), our method exceeds the rendering quality of Scaffold-GS in just 15K iterations.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained conditional diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential in image editing. However, they often face challenges with temporal consistency, particularly in the talking head domain, where continuous changes in facial expressions intensify the level of difficulty. These issues stem from the independent editing of individual images and the inherent loss of temporal continuity during the editing process. In this paper, we introduce Follow Your Motion (FYM), a generic framework for maintaining temporal consistency in portrait editing. Specifically, given portrait images rendered by a pre-trained 3D Gaussian Splatting model, we first develop a diffusion model that intuitively and inherently learns motion trajectory changes at different scales and pixel coordinates, from the first frame to each subsequent frame. This approach ensures that temporally inconsistent edited avatars inherit the motion information from the rendered avatars. Secondly, to maintain fine-grained expression temporal consistency in talking head editing, we propose a dynamic re-weighted attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns higher weight coefficients to landmark points in space and dynamically updates these weights based on landmark loss, achieving more consistent and refined facial expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of temporal consistency and can be used to optimize and compensate for temporally inconsistent outputs in a range of applications, such as text-driven editing, relighting, and various other applications.",

In this paper, we introduce ABC-GS, a novel framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve high-quality 3D style transfer. To this end, a controllable matching stage is designed to achieve precise alignment between scene content and style features through segmentation masks. Moreover, a style transfer loss function based on feature alignment is proposed to ensure that the outcomes of style transfer accurately reflect the global style of the reference image. Furthermore, the original geometric information of the scene is preserved with the depth loss and Gaussian regularization terms.

In this paper, we propose Segment then Splat, a 3D-aware open vocabulary segmentation approach for both static and dynamic scenes based on Gaussian Splatting. Segment then Splat reverses the long established approach of \"segmentation after reconstruction\" by dividing Gaussians into distinct object sets before reconstruction. Once the reconstruction is complete, the scene is naturally segmented into individual objects, achieving true 3D segmentation. This approach not only eliminates Gaussian-object misalignment issues in dynamic scenes but also accelerates the optimization process, as it eliminates the need for learning a separate language field. After optimization, a CLIP embedding is assigned to each object to enable open-vocabulary querying. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in both static and dynamic scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Novel-view synthesis (NVS) for dynamic scenes from 2D images presents significant challenges due to the spatial complexity and temporal variability of such scenes. Recently, inspired by the remarkable success of NVS using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), researchers have sought to extend 3D Gaussian models to four dimensions (4D) for dynamic novel-view synthesis. However, methods based on 4D rotation and scaling introduce spatiotemporal deformation into the 4D covariance matrix, necessitating the slicing of 4D Gaussians into 3D Gaussians. This process increases redundant computations as timestamps change-an inherent characteristic of dynamic scene rendering. Additionally, performing calculations on a four-dimensional matrix is computationally intensive. In this paper, we introduce Disentangled 4D Gaussian Splatting (Disentangled4DGS), a novel representation and rendering approach that disentangles temporal and spatial deformations, thereby eliminating the reliance on 4D matrix computations. We extend the 3DGS rendering process to 4D, enabling the projection of temporal and spatial deformations into dynamic 2D Gaussians in ray space. Consequently, our method facilitates faster dynamic scene synthesis. Moreover, it reduces storage requirements by at least 4.5\\% due to our efficient presentation method. Our approach achieves an unprecedented average rendering speed of 343 FPS at a resolution of $1352\\times1014$ on an RTX 3090 GPU, with experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrating its competitive performance in both monocular and multi-view scenarios.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has revolutionized novel view synthesis with its efficient, explicit representation. However, it lacks frequency interpretability, making it difficult to separate low-frequency structures from fine details. We introduce a frequency-decomposed 3D-GS framework that groups 3D Gaussians that correspond to subbands in the Laplacian Pyrmaids of the input images. Our approach enforces coherence within each subband (i.e., group of 3D Gaussians) through dedicated regularization, ensuring well-separated frequency components. We extend color values to both positive and negative ranges, allowing higher-frequency layers to add or subtract residual details. To stabilize optimization, we employ a progressive training scheme that refines details in a coarse-to-fine manner. Beyond interpretability, this frequency-aware design unlocks a range of practical benefits. Explicit frequency separation enables advanced 3D editing and stylization, allowing precise manipulation of specific frequency bands. It also supports dynamic level-of-detail control for progressive rendering, streaming, foveated rendering and fast geometry interaction. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method provides improved control and flexibility for emerging applications in scene editing and interactive rendering. Our code will be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Urban scene reconstruction requires modeling both static infrastructure and dynamic elements while supporting diverse environmental conditions. We present \\textbf{StyledStreets}, a multi-style street simulator that achieves instruction-driven scene editing with guaranteed spatial and temporal consistency. Building on a state-of-the-art Gaussian Splatting framework for street scenarios enhanced by our proposed pose optimization and multi-view training, our method enables photorealistic style transfers across seasons, weather conditions, and camera setups through three key innovations: First, a hybrid embedding scheme disentangles persistent scene geometry from transient style attributes, allowing realistic environmental edits while preserving structural integrity. Second, uncertainty-aware rendering mitigates supervision noise from diffusion priors, enabling robust training across extreme style variations. Third, a unified parametric model prevents geometric drift through regularized updates, maintaining multi-view consistency across seven vehicle-mounted cameras.   Our framework preserves the original scene's motion patterns and geometric relationships. Qualitative results demonstrate plausible transitions between diverse conditions (snow, sandstorm, night), while quantitative evaluations show state-of-the-art geometric accuracy under style transfers. The approach establishes new capabilities for urban simulation, with applications in autonomous vehicle testing and augmented reality systems requiring reliable environmental consistency.

In contrast, our method only requires a multi-view capture of a single static frame. We represent garments as hybrid mesh-embedded 3D Gaussian splats, where the Gaussians capture near-field shading and high-frequency details, while the mesh encodes far-field albedo and optimized reflectance parameters. We achieve novel pose generalization by exploiting the mesh from our hybrid approach, enabling physics-based simulation and surface rendering techniques, while also capturing fine details with Gaussians that accurately reconstruct garment details.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in 2D and multimodal models have achieved remarkable success by leveraging large-scale training on extensive datasets. However, extending these achievements to enable free-form interactions and high-level semantic operations with complex 3D/4D scenes remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the limited availability of large-scale, annotated 3D/4D or multi-view datasets, which are crucial for generalizable vision and language tasks such as open-vocabulary and prompt-based segmentation, language-guided editing, and visual question answering (VQA). In this paper, we introduce Feature4X, a universal framework designed to extend any functionality from 2D vision foundation model into the 4D realm, using only monocular video input, which is widely available from user-generated content. The \"X\" in Feature4X represents its versatility, enabling any task through adaptable, model-conditioned 4D feature field distillation. At the core of our framework is a dynamic optimization strategy that unifies multiple model capabilities into a single representation. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, Feature4X is the first method to distill and lift the features of video foundation models (e.g., SAM2, InternVideo2) into an explicit 4D feature field using Gaussian Splatting. Our experiments showcase novel view segment anything, geometric and appearance scene editing, and free-form VQA across all time steps, empowered by LLMs in feedback loops. These advancements broaden the scope of agentic AI applications by providing a foundation for scalable, contextually and spatiotemporally aware systems capable of immersive dynamic 4D scene interaction.",

However, the substantial data volume of 3DGS and its attributes impede its practical utility, requiring compression techniques for reducing memory cost. Nevertheless, the unorganized shape of 3DGS leads to difficulties in compression. To formulate unstructured attributes into normative distribution, we propose a well-structured tri-plane to encode Gaussian attributes, leveraging the distribution of attributes for compression. To exploit the correlations among adjacent Gaussians, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is used when decoding Gaussian distribution from the Tri-plane. We also introduce Gaussian position information as a prior of the position-sensitive decoder. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive wavelet loss, aiming to focus on the high-frequency details as iterations increase.

We introduce EVolSplat, an efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting model for urban scenes that works in a feed-forward manner. Unlike existing feed-forward, pixel-aligned 3DGS methods, which often suffer from issues like multi-view inconsistencies and duplicated content, our approach predicts 3D Gaussians across multiple frames within a unified volume using a 3D convolutional network. This is achieved by initializing 3D Gaussians with noisy depth predictions, and then refining their geometric properties in 3D space and predicting color based on 2D textures. Our model also handles distant views and the sky with a flexible hemisphere background model. This enables us to perform fast, feed-forward reconstruction while achieving real-time rendering. Experimental evaluations on the KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality compared to existing feed-forward 3DGS- and NeRF-based methods.",

In this work, we tackle the more challenging and underexplored Extrapolated View Synthesis (EVS) task. Here we enable GS-based models trained with limited view coverage to generalize well to extrapolated views. To achieve our goal, we propose a view augmentation framework to guide training through a coarse-to-fine process. At the coarse stage, we reduce rendering artifacts due to insufficient view coverage by introducing a regularization strategy at both appearance and geometry levels. At the fine stage, we generate reliable view priors to provide further training guidance. To this end, we incorporate an occlusion awareness into the view prior generation process, and refine the view priors with the aid of coarse stage output. We call our framework Enhanced View Prior Guidance for Splatting (EVPGS). To comprehensively evaluate EVPGS on the EVS task, we collect a real-world dataset called Merchandise3D dedicated to the EVS scenario. Experiments on three datasets including both real and synthetic demonstrate EVPGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, while improving synthesis quality at extrapolated views for GS-based methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

    "abstract": "3D reconstruction of highly deformable surfaces (e.g. cloths) from monocular RGB videos is a challenging problem, and no solution provides a consistent and accurate recovery of fine-grained surface details. To account for the ill-posed nature of the setting, existing methods use deformation models with statistical, neural, or physical priors. They also predominantly rely on nonadaptive discrete surface representations (e.g. polygonal meshes), perform frame-by-frame optimisation leading to error propagation, and suffer from poor gradients of the mesh-based differentiable renderers. Consequently, fine surface details such as cloth wrinkles are often not recovered with the desired accuracy. In response to these limitations, we propose ThinShell-SfT, a new method for non-rigid 3D tracking that represents a surface as an implicit and continuous spatiotemporal neural field. We incorporate continuous thin shell physics prior based on the Kirchhoff-Love model for spatial regularisation, which starkly contrasts the discretised alternatives of earlier works. Lastly, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting to differentiably render the surface into image space and optimise the deformations based on analysis-bysynthesis principles. Our Thin-Shell-SfT outperforms prior works qualitatively and quantitatively thanks to our continuous surface formulation in conjunction with a specially tailored simulation prior and surface-induced 3D Gaussians.

With depth map generation, spatial information for every pixel within the TDOM is retrieved and can reconstruct the scene with high precision. Divide-and-conquer strategy achieves excellent GS training and rendering with high-resolution TDOMs at a lower resource cost, which preserves higher quality of rendering on complex terrain and thin structure without a decrease in efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of large-scale scene reconstruction and high-precision terrain modeling.

A widely used strategy is to learn unsigned distance functions (UDFs) by checking if their appearance conforms to the image observations through neural rendering. However, it is still hard to learn continuous and implicit UDF representations through 3D Gaussians splatting (3DGS) due to the discrete and explicit scene representation, i.e., 3D Gaussians. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel approach to bridge the gap between 3D Gaussians and UDFs. Our key idea is to overfit thin and flat 2D Gaussian planes on surfaces, and then, leverage the self-supervision and gradient-based inference to supervise unsigned distances in both near and far area to surfaces. To this end, we introduce novel constraints and strategies to constrain the learning of 2D Gaussians to pursue more stable optimization and more reliable self-supervision, addressing the challenges brought by complicated gradient field on or near the zero level set of UDFs. We report numerical and visual comparisons with the state-of-the-art on widely used benchmarks and real data to show our advantages in terms of accuracy, efficiency, completeness, and sharpness of reconstructed open surfaces with boundaries.",

Existing methods, which optimize per-image appearance and transient occlusion through implicit neural networks from dense training views (approximately 1000 images), struggle to perform effectively under sparse input conditions, resulting in noticeable artifacts. To this end, we propose SparseGS-W, a novel framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables the reconstruction of complex outdoor scenes and handles occlusions and appearance changes with as few as five training images. We leverage geometric priors and constrained diffusion priors to compensate for the lack of multi-view information from extremely sparse input. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Constrained Novel-View Enhancement module to iteratively improve the quality of rendered novel views during the Gaussian optimization process. Furthermore, we propose an Occlusion Handling module, which flexibly removes occlusions utilizing the inherent high-quality inpainting capability of constrained diffusion priors. Both modules are capable of extracting appearance features from any user-provided reference image, enabling flexible modeling of illumination-consistent scenes. Extensive experiments on the PhotoTourism and Tanks and Temples datasets demonstrate that SparseGS-W achieves state-of-the-art performance not only in full-reference metrics, but also in commonly used non-reference metrics such as FID, ClipIQA, and MUSIQ.",

    "abstract": "Accurate object segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D segmentation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles with accurately delineating object boundaries, as Gaussian primitives often span across object edges due to their inherent volume and the lack of semantic guidance during training. In order to tackle these challenges, we introduce Clear Object Boundaries for 3DGS Segmentation (COB-GS), which aims to improve segmentation accuracy by clearly delineating blurry boundaries of interwoven Gaussian primitives within the scene. Unlike existing approaches that remove ambiguous Gaussians and sacrifice visual quality, COB-GS, as a 3DGS refinement method, jointly optimizes semantic and visual information, allowing the two different levels to cooperate with each other effectively. Specifically, for the semantic guidance, we introduce a boundary-adaptive Gaussian splitting technique that leverages semantic gradient statistics to identify and split ambiguous Gaussians, aligning them closely with object boundaries. For the visual optimization, we rectify the degraded suboptimal texture of the 3DGS scene, particularly along the refined boundary structures. Experimental results show that COB-GS substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against inaccurate masks from pre-trained model, yielding clear boundaries while preserving high visual quality.

However, reliance on Cartesian coordinates limits 3DGS's performance on distant objects, which is important for reconstructing unbounded outdoor environments. We found that, despite its ultimate simplicity, using homogeneous coordinates, a concept on the projective geometry, for the 3DGS pipeline remarkably improves the rendering accuracies of distant objects. We therefore propose Homogeneous Gaussian Splatting (HoGS) incorporating homogeneous coordinates into the 3DGS framework, providing a unified representation for enhancing near and distant objects. HoGS effectively manages both expansive spatial positions and scales particularly in outdoor unbounded environments by adopting projective geometry principles. Experiments show that HoGS significantly enhances accuracy in reconstructing distant objects while maintaining high-quality rendering of nearby objects, along with fast training speed and real-time rendering capability.

However, these methods struggle in few-shot scenarios due to limited supervision. In this paper, we present NexusGS, a 3DGS-based approach that enhances novel view synthesis from sparse-view images by directly embedding depth information into point clouds, without relying on complex manual regularizations. Exploiting the inherent epipolar geometry of 3DGS, our method introduces a novel point cloud densification strategy that initializes 3DGS with a dense point cloud, reducing randomness in point placement while preventing over-smoothing and overfitting. Specifically, NexusGS comprises three key steps: Epipolar Depth Nexus, Flow-Resilient Depth Blending, and Flow-Filtered Depth Pruning. These steps leverage optical flow and camera poses to compute accurate depth maps, while mitigating the inaccuracies often associated with optical flow. By incorporating epipolar depth priors, NexusGS ensures reliable dense point cloud coverage and supports stable 3DGS training under sparse-view conditions. Experiments demonstrate that NexusGS significantly enhances depth accuracy and rendering quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin. Furthermore, we validate the superiority of our generated point clouds by substantially boosting the performance of competing methods. Project page: https://usmizuki.github.io/NexusGS/.",

    "abstract": "In the Generative AI era, safeguarding 3D models has become increasingly urgent. While invisible watermarking is well-established for 2D images with encoder-decoder frameworks, generalizable and robust solutions for 3D remain elusive. The main difficulty arises from the renderer between the 3D encoder and 2D decoder, which disrupts direct gradient flow and complicates training. Existing 3D methods typically rely on per-scene iterative optimization, resulting in time inefficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a single-pass watermarking approach for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a well-known yet underexplored representation for watermarking. We identify two major challenges: (1) ensuring effective training generalized across diverse 3D models, and (2) reliably extracting watermarks from free-view renderings, even under distortions. Our framework, named GS-Marker, incorporates a 3D encoder to embed messages, distortion layers to enhance resilience against various distortions, and a 2D decoder to extract watermarks from renderings. A key innovation is the Adaptive Marker Control mechanism that adaptively perturbs the initially optimized 3DGS, escaping local minima and improving both training stability and convergence. Extensive experiments show that GS-Marker outperforms per-scene training approaches in terms of decoding accuracy and model fidelity, while also significantly reducing computation time.",

These problems limit the application of 3D Gaussian Splatting in low-light conditions in the field of robotics, including high-fidelity modeling and feature matching. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised multi-view stereoscopic system based on Gaussian Splatting, called Low-Light Gaussian Splatting (LLGS). This system aims to enhance images in low-light environments while reconstructing the scene. Our method introduces a decomposable Gaussian representation called M-Color, which separately characterizes color information for targeted enhancement.

To resolve this, we propose StableGS, a novel framework that decouples geometric regularization from final appearance rendering. Its core is a Dual Opacity architecture that creates two separate rendering paths: a ``Geometric Regularization Path\" to bear strong depth-based constraints for structural correctness, and an ``Appearance Refinement Path\" to generate high-fidelity details upon this stable foundation. We complement this with a synergistic set of geometric constraints: a self-supervised depth consistency loss and an external geometric prior enabled by our efficient global scale optimization algorithm. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show StableGS not only eliminates floaters but also resolves the common blur-artifact trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art geometric accuracy and visual quality.",

To address this gap, we propose 4DGC, a novel rate-aware 4D Gaussian compression framework that significantly reduces storage size while maintaining superior RD performance for FVV. Specifically, 4DGC introduces a motion-aware dynamic Gaussian representation that utilizes a compact motion grid combined with sparse compensated Gaussians to exploit inter-frame similarities. This representation effectively handles large motions, preserving quality and reducing temporal redundancy. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end compression scheme that employs differentiable quantization and a tiny implicit entropy model to compress the motion grid and compensated Gaussians efficiently. The entire framework is jointly optimized using a rate-distortion trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4DGC supports variable bitrates and consistently outperforms existing methods in RD performance across multiple datasets.",

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown encouraging performance for open vocabulary scene understanding tasks. However, previous methods cannot distinguish 3D instance-level information, which usually predicts a heatmap between the scene feature and text query. In this paper, we propose PanoGS, a novel and effective 3D panoptic open vocabulary scene understanding approach. Technically, to learn accurate 3D language features that can scale to large indoor scenarios, we adopt the pyramid tri-plane to model the latent continuous parametric feature space and use a 3D feature decoder to regress the multi-view fused 2D feature cloud. Besides, we propose language-guided graph cuts that synergistically leverage reconstructed geometry and learned language cues to group 3D Gaussian primitives into a set of super-primitives. To obtain 3D consistent instance, we perform graph clustering based segmentation with SAM-guided edge affinity computation between different super-primitives. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets show better or more competitive performance on 3D panoptic open vocabulary scene understanding.

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary panoptic reconstruction is a challenging task for simultaneous scene reconstruction and understanding. Recently, methods have been proposed for 3D scene understanding based on Gaussian splatting. However, these methods are multi-staged, suffering from the accumulated errors and the dependence of hand-designed components. To streamline the pipeline and achieve global optimization, we propose PanopticSplatting, an end-to-end system for open-vocabulary panoptic reconstruction. Our method introduces query-guided Gaussian segmentation with local cross attention, lifting 2D instance masks without cross-frame association in an end-to-end way. The local cross attention within view frustum effectively reduces the training memory, making our model more accessible to large scenes with more Gaussians and objects. In addition, to address the challenge of noisy labels in 2D pseudo masks, we propose label blending to promote consistent 3D segmentation with less noisy floaters, as well as label warping on 2D predictions which enhances multi-view coherence and segmentation accuracy. Our method demonstrates strong performances in 3D scene panoptic reconstruction on the ScanNet-V2 and ScanNet++ datasets, compared with both NeRF-based and Gaussian-based panoptic reconstruction methods. Moreover, PanopticSplatting can be easily generalized to numerous variants of Gaussian splatting, and we demonstrate its robustness on different Gaussian base models.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing arbitrary or previously unseen categories is essential for comprehensive real-world 3D scene understanding. Currently, all existing methods rely on 2D or textual modalities during training or together at inference. This highlights the clear absence of a model capable of processing 3D data alone for learning semantics end-to-end, along with the necessary data to train such a model. Meanwhile, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as the de facto standard for 3D scene representation across various vision tasks. However, effectively integrating semantic reasoning into 3DGS in a generalizable manner remains an open challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce SceneSplat, to our knowledge the first large-scale 3D indoor scene understanding approach that operates natively on 3DGS. Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised learning scheme that unlocks rich 3D feature learning from unlabeled scenes. To power the proposed methods, we introduce SceneSplat-7K, the first large-scale 3DGS dataset for indoor scenes, comprising 7916 scenes derived from seven established datasets, such as ScanNet and Matterport3D. Generating SceneSplat-7K required computational resources equivalent to 150 GPU days on an L4 GPU, enabling standardized benchmarking for 3DGS-based reasoning for indoor scenes. Our exhaustive experiments on SceneSplat-7K demonstrate the significant benefit of the proposed method over the established baselines.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in 3D reconstruction and neural rendering have significantly propelled the capabilities of photo-realistic 3D scene rendering across various academic and industrial fields. The 3D Gaussian Splatting technique, alongside its derivatives, integrates the advantages of primitive-based and volumetric representations to deliver top-tier rendering quality and efficiency. Despite these advancements, the method tends to generate excessive redundant noisy Gaussians overfitted to every training view, which degrades the rendering quality. Additionally, while 3D Gaussian Splatting excels in small-scale and object-centric scenes, its application to larger scenes is hindered by constraints such as limited video memory, excessive optimization duration, and variable appearance across views. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFocus, an innovative approach that incorporates a patch attention algorithm to refine rendering quality and implements a Gaussian constraints strategy to minimize redundancy. Moreover, we propose a subdivision reconstruction strategy for large-scale scenes, dividing them into smaller, manageable blocks for individual training. Our results indicate that GaussianFocus significantly reduces unnecessary Gaussians and enhances rendering quality, surpassing existing State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to effectively manage and render large scenes, such as urban environments, whilst maintaining high fidelity in the visual output.",

These robots demand sustained task execution and efficient scene updates-challenges current approaches fail to meet. To address these limitations, we propose GS-LTS (Gaussian Splatting for Long-Term Service), a 3DGS-based system enabling indoor robots to manage diverse tasks in dynamic environments over time. GS-LTS detects scene changes (e.g., object addition or removal) via single-image change detection, employs a rule-based policy to autonomously collect multi-view observations, and efficiently updates the scene representation through Gaussian editing. Additionally, we propose a simulation-based benchmark that automatically generates scene change data as compact configuration scripts, providing a standardized, user-friendly evaluation benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate GS-LTS's advantages in reconstruction, navigation, and superior scene updates-faster and higher quality than the image training baseline-advancing 3DGS for long-term robotic operations.

Leveraging spherical projection, we drive the refinement of the primitives uniquely from LiDAR measurements.

To overcome these limitations, we propose ProtoGS to learn Gaussian prototypes to represent Gaussian primitives, significantly reducing the total Gaussian amount without sacrificing visual quality. Our method directly uses Gaussian prototypes to enable efficient rendering and leverage the resulting reconstruction loss to guide prototype learning. To further optimize memory efficiency during training, we incorporate structure-from-motion (SfM) points as anchor points to group Gaussian primitives. Gaussian prototypes are derived within each group by clustering of K-means, and both the anchor points and the prototypes are optimized jointly.

We then pre-train a StyleUnet-based network to handle complex pose-dependent non-rigid deformation, which can capture high-frequency appearance details but is too resource-intensive for mobile devices. To overcome this, we \"bake\" the non-rigid deformations into a lightweight MLP-based network using a distillation technique and develop blend shapes to compensate for details.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for real-time, high-performance rendering, enabling a wide range of applications. However, representing 3D scenes with numerous explicit Gaussian primitives imposes significant storage and memory overhead. Recent studies have shown that high-quality rendering can be achieved with a substantially reduced number of Gaussians when represented with high-precision attributes. Nevertheless, existing 3DGS compression methods still rely on a relatively large number of Gaussians, focusing primarily on attribute compression. This is because a smaller set of Gaussians becomes increasingly sensitive to lossy attribute compression, leading to severe quality degradation. Since the number of Gaussians is directly tied to computational costs, it is essential to reduce the number of Gaussians effectively rather than only optimizing storage. In this paper, we propose Optimized Minimal Gaussians representation (OMG), which significantly reduces storage while using a minimal number of primitives. First, we determine the distinct Gaussian from the near ones, minimizing redundancy without sacrificing quality. Second, we propose a compact and precise attribute representation that efficiently captures both continuity and irregularity among primitives. Additionally, we propose a sub-vector quantization technique for improved irregularity representation, maintaining fast training with a negligible codebook size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMG reduces storage requirements by nearly 50% compared to the previous state-of-the-art and enables 600+ FPS rendering while maintaining high rendering quality.

    "abstract": "4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has recently gained considerable attention as a method for reconstructing dynamic scenes. Despite achieving superior quality, 4DGS typically requires substantial storage and suffers from slow rendering speed. In this work, we delve into these issues and identify two key sources of temporal redundancy. (Q1) \\textbf{Short-Lifespan Gaussians}: 4DGS uses a large portion of Gaussians with short temporal span to represent scene dynamics, leading to an excessive number of Gaussians. (Q2) \\textbf{Inactive Gaussians}: When rendering, only a small subset of Gaussians contributes to each frame. Despite this, all Gaussians are processed during rasterization, resulting in redundant computation overhead. To address these redundancies, we present \\textbf{4DGS-1K}, which runs at over 1000 FPS on modern GPUs. For Q1, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Variation Score, a new pruning criterion that effectively removes short-lifespan Gaussians while encouraging 4DGS to capture scene dynamics using Gaussians with longer temporal spans. For Q2, we store a mask for active Gaussians across consecutive frames, significantly reducing redundant computations in rendering. Compared to vanilla 4DGS, our method achieves a $41\\times$ reduction in storage and $9\\times$ faster rasterization speed on complex dynamic scenes, while maintaining comparable visual quality.

By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques with foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering feature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of knowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works on feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional features for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss between distilled features and foundation model features. To address these challenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and Gaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To validate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature similarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to highlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach encompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language models (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models (LMMs/LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate real-world applicability, we deploy M3's feature field in indoor scenes on a quadruped robot.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis performance. While conventional methods require per-scene optimization, more recently several feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate pixel-aligned Gaussian representations with a learnable network, which are generalizable to different scenes. However, these methods simply combine pixel-aligned Gaussians from multiple views as scene representations, thereby leading to artifacts and extra memory cost without fully capturing the relations of Gaussians from different images. In this paper, we propose Gaussian Graph Network (GGN) to generate efficient and generalizable Gaussian representations. Specifically, we construct Gaussian Graphs to model the relations of Gaussian groups from different views. To support message passing at Gaussian level, we reformulate the basic graph operations over Gaussian representations, enabling each Gaussian to benefit from its connected Gaussian groups with Gaussian feature fusion. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian pooling layer to aggregate various Gaussian groups for efficient representations. We conduct experiments on the large-scale RealEstate10K and ACID datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.

    "abstract": "In large-scale scene reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting, it is common to partition the scene into multiple smaller regions and reconstruct them individually. However, existing division methods are occlusion-agnostic, meaning that each region may contain areas with severe occlusions. As a result, the cameras within those regions are less correlated, leading to a low average contribution to the overall reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an occlusion-aware scene division strategy that clusters training cameras based on their positions and co-visibilities to acquire multiple regions. Cameras in such regions exhibit stronger correlations and a higher average contribution, facilitating high-quality scene reconstruction. We further propose a region-based rendering technique to accelerate large scene rendering, which culls Gaussians invisible to the region where the viewpoint is located. Such a technique significantly speeds up the rendering without compromising quality. Extensive experiments on multiple large scenes show that our method achieves superior reconstruction results with faster rendering speed compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

The primary challenge stems from the lack of specific training data for close-up views, leading to the inability of current methods to render these views accurately. To address this issue, we introduce a novel pseudo-label-based learning strategy. This approach leverages pseudo-labels derived from existing training data to provide targeted supervision across a wide range of close-up viewpoints.

To generate diverse camera poses and unbounded spatial extent of real-world scenes, while ensuring generalization to arbitrary text prompts, previous methods fine-tune 2D generative models to jointly model camera poses and multi-view images. However, these methods suffer from instability when extending 2D generative models to joint modeling due to the modality gap, which necessitates additional models to stabilize training and inference. In this work, we propose an architecture and a sampling strategy to jointly model multi-view images and camera poses when fine-tuning a video generation model. Our core idea is a dual-stream architecture that attaches a dedicated pose generation model alongside a pre-trained video generation model via communication blocks, generating multi-view images and camera poses through separate streams. This design reduces interference between the pose and image modalities. Additionally, we propose an asynchronous sampling strategy that denoises camera poses faster than multi-view images, allowing rapidly denoised poses to condition multi-view generation, reducing mutual ambiguity and enhancing cross-modal consistency. Trained on multiple large-scale real-world datasets (RealEstate10K, MVImgNet, DL3DV-10K, ACID), VideoRFSplat outperforms existing text-to-3D direct generation methods that heavily depend on post-hoc refinement via score distillation sampling, achieving superior results without such refinement.",

However, the quality of reconstructions depends heavily on high-quality input images and precise camera poses, which are not that trivial to fulfill in real-world scenarios. Capturing dynamic scenes with handheld monocular cameras, for instance, typically involves simultaneous movement of both the camera and objects within a single exposure. This combined motion frequently results in image blur that existing methods cannot adequately handle. To address these challenges, we introduce BARD-GS, a novel approach for robust dynamic scene reconstruction that effectively handles blurry inputs and imprecise camera poses. Our method comprises two main components: 1) camera motion deblurring and 2) object motion deblurring. By explicitly decomposing motion blur into camera motion blur and object motion blur and modeling them separately, we achieve significantly improved rendering results in dynamic regions. In addition, we collect a real-world motion blur dataset of dynamic scenes to evaluate our approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BARD-GS effectively reconstructs high-quality dynamic scenes under realistic conditions, significantly outperforming existing methods.",

These limitations lead to geometric detail loss, temporal instability, and inefficient point distribution. To address these issues, we propose HandSplat, a novel Gaussian Splatting-based framework that enhances both fidelity and stability for hand rendering. To improve fidelity, we extend standard 3DGS attributes with implicit geometry and appearance embeddings for finer non-rigid motion modeling while preserving the static hand characteristic modeled by original 3DGS attributes. Additionally, we introduce a local gradient-aware densification strategy that dynamically refines Gaussian density in high-variation regions. To improve stability, we incorporate pose-conditioned attribute regularization to encourage attribute consistency across similar poses, mitigating temporal artifacts. Extensive experiments on InterHand2.6M demonstrate that HandSplat surpasses existing methods in fidelity and stability while achieving real-time performance.

However, existing novel view synthesis methods struggle with temporal coherence and visual fidelity, leading to flickering and inconsistency. To address these challenges, we introduce history-awareness, leveraging previous frames to reconstruct the scene and improve quality and stability. We propose a hybrid splat-voxel feed-forward scene reconstruction approach that combines Gaussian Splatting to propagate information over time, with a hierarchical voxel grid for temporal fusion. Gaussian primitives are efficiently warped over time using a motion graph that extends 2D tracking models to 3D motion, while a sparse voxel transformer integrates new temporal observations in an error-aware manner. Crucially, our method does not require training on multi-view video datasets, which are currently limited in size and diversity, and can be directly applied to sparse-view video streams in a history-aware manner at inference time. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both static and streaming scene reconstruction, effectively reducing temporal artifacts and visual artifacts while running at interactive rates (15 fps with 350ms delay) on a single H100 GPU.

Opti3DGS leverages image frequency modulation, initially enforcing a coarse scene representation and progressively refining it by modulating frequency details in the training images.

Furthermore, we show that our method integrates seamlessly with many 3DGS-based techniques, consistently reducing the number of Gaussian primitives while maintaining, and often improving, visual quality.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most influential works in the past year. Due to its efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis capabilities, it has been widely adopted in many research fields and applications. Nevertheless, 3DGS still faces challenges to properly manage the number of Gaussian primitives that are used during scene reconstruction. Following the adaptive density control (ADC) mechanism of 3D Gaussian Splatting, new Gaussians in under-reconstructed regions are created, while Gaussians that do not contribute to the rendering quality are pruned. We observe that those criteria for densifying and pruning Gaussians can sometimes lead to worse rendering by introducing artifacts. We especially observe under-reconstructed background or overfitted foreground regions. To encounter both problems, we propose three new improvements to the adaptive density control mechanism. Those include a correction for the scene extent calculation that does not only rely on camera positions, an exponentially ascending gradient threshold to improve training convergence, and significance-aware pruning strategy to avoid background artifacts. With these adaptions, we show that the rendering quality improves while using the same number of Gaussians primitives. Furthermore, with our improvements, the training converges considerably faster, allowing for more than twice as fast training times while yielding better quality than 3DGS. Finally, our contributions are easily compatible with most existing derivative works of 3DGS making them relevant for future works.",

To adapt 3DGS for dynamic content, deformable 3DGS incorporates temporally deformable primitives with learnable latent embeddings to capture complex motions. Despite its impressive performance, the high-dimensional embeddings and vast number of primitives lead to substantial storage requirements. In this paper, we introduce a \\textbf{Light}weight \\textbf{4}D\\textbf{GS} framework, called Light4GS, that employs significance pruning with a deep context model to provide a lightweight storage-efficient dynamic 3DGS representation. The proposed Light4GS is based on 4DGS that is a typical representation of deformable 3DGS. Specifically, our framework is built upon two core components: (1) a spatio-temporal significance pruning strategy that eliminates over 64\\% of the deformable primitives, followed by an entropy-constrained spherical harmonics compression applied to the remainder; and (2) a deep context model that integrates intra- and inter-prediction with hyperprior into a coarse-to-fine context structure to enable efficient multiscale latent embedding compression.

    "abstract": "Synthesizing consistent and photorealistic 3D scenes is an open problem in computer vision. Video diffusion models generate impressive videos but cannot directly synthesize 3D representations, i.e., lack 3D consistency in the generated sequences. In addition, directly training generative 3D models is challenging due to a lack of 3D training data at scale. In this work, we present Generative Gaussian Splatting (GGS) -- a novel approach that integrates a 3D representation with a pre-trained latent video diffusion model. Specifically, our model synthesizes a feature field parameterized via 3D Gaussian primitives. The feature field is then either rendered to feature maps and decoded into multi-view images, or directly upsampled into a 3D radiance field. We evaluate our approach on two common benchmark datasets for scene synthesis, RealEstate10K and ScanNet+, and find that our proposed GGS model significantly improves both the 3D consistency of the generated multi-view images, and the quality of the generated 3D scenes over all relevant baselines. Compared to a similar model without 3D representation, GGS improves FID on the generated 3D scenes by ~20% on both RealEstate10K and ScanNet+. Project page: https://katjaschwarz.github.io/ggs/",

To tackle this problem, we introduce DeGauss, a simple and robust self-supervised framework for dynamic scene reconstruction based on a decoupled dynamic-static Gaussian Splatting design. DeGauss models dynamic elements with foreground Gaussians and static content with background Gaussians, using a probabilistic mask to coordinate their composition and enable independent yet complementary optimization. DeGauss generalizes robustly across a wide range of real-world scenarios, from casual image collections to long, dynamic egocentric videos, without relying on complex heuristics or extensive supervision. Experiments on benchmarks including NeRF-on-the-go, ADT, AEA, Hot3D, and EPIC-Fields demonstrate that DeGauss consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a strong baseline for generalizable, distractor-free 3D reconstructionin highly dynamic, interaction-rich environments.

In contrast, this work introduces Gaussian on-the-fly Splatting (abbreviated as On-the-Fly GS), a progressive framework enabling near real-time 3DGS optimization during image capture. As each image arrives, its pose and sparse points are updated via On-the-Fly SfM, and newly optimized Gaussians are immediately integrated into the 3DGS field. To achieve this, we propose a progressive Local & Semi-Global optimization to prioritize the new image and its neighbors by their corresponding overlapping relationship, allowing the new image and its overlapping images to get more training. To further stabilize training across previous and new images, an adaptive learning rate schedule balances the iterations and the learning rate. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our On-the-Fly GS reduces training time significantly, optimizing each new image in seconds with minimal rendering loss, offering one of the first practical steps toward rapid, progressive 3DGS reconstruction.",

CAT-3DGS introduces a context-adaptive triplane hyperprior for end-to-end optimized compression, delivering state-of-the-art coding performance. Despite this, it requires prolonged training and decoding time. To address these limitations, we propose CAT-3DGS Pro, an enhanced version of CAT-3DGS that improves both compression performance and computational efficiency. First, we introduce a PCA-guided vector-matrix hyperprior, which replaces the triplane-based hyperprior to reduce redundant parameters. To achieve a more balanced rate-distortion trade-off and faster encoding, we propose an alternate optimization strategy (A-RDO). Additionally, we refine the sampling rate optimization method in CAT-3DGS, leading to significant improvements in rate-distortion performance. These enhancements result in a 46.6% BD-rate reduction and 3x speedup in training time on BungeeNeRF, while achieving 5x acceleration in decoding speed for the Amsterdam scene compared to CAT-3DGS.",

At the same time, its large model size requires efficient compression for storage and transmission. However, compression techniques, especially quantization-based methods, degrade the integrity of existing 3DGS watermarking methods, thus creating the need for a novel methodology that is robust against compression. To ensure reliable watermark detection under compression, we propose a compression-tolerant 3DGS watermarking method that preserves watermark integrity and rendering quality. Our approach utilizes an anchor-based 3DGS, embedding the watermark into anchor attributes, particularly the anchor feature, to enhance security and rendering quality. We also propose a quantization distortion layer that injects quantization noise during training, preserving the watermark after quantization-based compression. Moreover, we employ a frequency-aware anchor growing strategy that enhances rendering quality by effectively identifying Gaussians in high-frequency regions, and an HSV loss to mitigate color artifacts for further rendering quality improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method preserves the watermark even under compression and maintains high rendering quality.",

While previous studies have leveraged visual perception to estimate spatial acoustics, the combined use of surface normal and structural details from 3D representations in acoustic modeling has been underexplored. Given their direct impact on sound wave reflections and propagation, surface normals should be jointly modeled with structural details to achieve accurate spatial acoustics. In this paper, we propose a surface-enhanced geometry-aware approach for NVAS to improve spatial acoustic modeling. To achieve this, we exploit geometric priors, such as image, depth map, surface normals, and point clouds obtained using a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based framework. We introduce a dual cross-attention-based transformer integrating geometrical constraints into frequency query to understand the surroundings of the emitter. Additionally, we design a ConvNeXt-based spectral features processing network called Spectral Refinement Network (SRN) to synthesize realistic binaural audio. Experimental results on the RWAVS and SoundSpace datasets highlight the necessity of our approach, as it surpasses existing methods in novel view acoustic synthesis.",

To address these issues, we propose Multi-Traversal Gaussian Splatting (MTGS), a novel approach that reconstructs high-quality driving scenes from arbitrarily collected multi-traversal data by modeling a shared static geometry while separately handling dynamic elements and appearance variations. Our method employs a multi-traversal dynamic scene graph with a shared static node and traversal-specific dynamic nodes, complemented by color correction nodes with learnable spherical harmonics coefficient residuals. This approach enables high-fidelity novel view synthesis and provides flexibility to navigate any viewpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale driving dataset, nuPlan, with multi-traversal data. Our results demonstrate that MTGS improves LPIPS by 23.5% and geometry accuracy by 46.3% compared to single-traversal baselines. The code and data would be available to the public.",

To relieve these challenges, we propose SPC-GS, leveraging Scene-layout-based Gaussian Initialization (SGI) and Semantic-Prompt Consistency (SPC) Regularization for open-world free view synthesis with sparse inputs. Specifically, SGI provides a dense, scene-layout-based Gaussian distribution by utilizing view-changed images generated from the video generation model and view-constraint Gaussian points densification. Additionally, SPC mitigates limited view supervision by employing semantic-prompt-based consistency constraints developed by SAM2. This approach leverages available semantics from training views, serving as instructive prompts, to optimize visually overlapping regions in novel views with 2D and 3D consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SPC-GS across Replica and ScanNet benchmarks. Notably, our SPC-GS achieves a 3.06 dB gain in PSNR for reconstruction quality and a 7.3% improvement in mIoU for open-world semantic segmentation.",

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention in the field of surface reconstruction due to its impressive geometric quality and computational efficiency. While recent relevant advancements in novel view synthesis under inconsistent illumination using 3DGS have shown promise, the challenge of robust surface reconstruction under such conditions is still being explored. To address this challenge, we propose a method called GS-3I. Specifically, to mitigate 3D Gaussian optimization bias caused by underexposed regions in single-view images, based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a tone mapping correction framework is introduced. Furthermore, inconsistent lighting across multi-view images, resulting from variations in camera settings and complex scene illumination, often leads to geometric constraint mismatches and deviations in the reconstructed surface. To overcome this, we propose a normal compensation mechanism that integrates reference normals extracted from single-view image with normals computed from multi-view observations to effectively constrain geometric inconsistencies. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that GS-3I can achieve robust and accurate surface reconstruction across complex illumination scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and versatility in this critical challenge. https://github.com/TFwang-9527/GS-3I",

In this paper we propose Swift4D, a divide-and-conquer 3D Gaussian Splatting method that can handle static and dynamic primitives separately, achieving a good trade-off between rendering quality and efficiency, motivated by the fact that most of the scene is the static primitive and does not require additional dynamic properties. Concretely, we focus on modeling dynamic transformations only for the dynamic primitives which benefits both efficiency and quality. We first employ a learnable decomposition strategy to separate the primitives, which relies on an additional parameter to classify primitives as static or dynamic. For the dynamic primitives, we employ a compact multi-resolution 4D Hash mapper to transform these primitives from canonical space into deformation space at each timestamp, and then mix the static and dynamic primitives to produce the final output. This divide-and-conquer method facilitates efficient training and reduces storage redundancy. Our method not only achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while being 20X faster in training than previous SOTA methods with a minimum storage requirement of only 30MB on real-world datasets.

Regrettably, it is challenging to integrate such a solution with varying light conditions, including shadows and light reflections, manual adjustments, and a physical engine. Recently, a few approaches have appeared that incorporate ray-tracing or mesh primitives into GS to address some of these caveats. However, no such solution can simultaneously solve all the existing limitations of the classical GS. Consequently, we introduce REdiSplats, which employs ray tracing and a mesh-based representation of flat 3D Gaussians. In practice, we model the scene using flat Gaussian distributions parameterized by the mesh. We can leverage fast ray tracing and control Gaussian modification by adjusting the mesh vertices. Moreover, REdiSplats allows modeling of light conditions, manual adjustments, and physical simulation. Furthermore, we can render our models using 3D tools such as Blender or Nvdiffrast, which opens the possibility of integrating them with all existing 3D graphics techniques dedicated to mesh representations.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the most important environment-perception and navigation algorithms for computer vision, robotics, and autonomous cars/drones. Hence, high quality and fast mapping becomes a fundamental problem. With the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as an explicit representation with excellent rendering quality and speed, state-of-the-art (SOTA) works introduce GS to SLAM. Compared to classical pointcloud-SLAM, GS-SLAM generates photometric information by learning from input camera views and synthesize unseen views with high-quality textures. However, these GS-SLAM fail when moving objects occupy the scene that violate the static assumption of bundle adjustment. The failed updates of moving GS affects the static GS and contaminates the full map over long frames. Although some efforts have been made by concurrent works to consider moving objects for GS-SLAM, they simply detect and remove the moving regions from GS rendering (\"anti'' dynamic GS-SLAM), where only the static background could benefit from GS. To this end, we propose the first real-time GS-SLAM, \"DynaGSLAM'', that achieves high-quality online GS rendering, tracking, motion predictions of moving objects in dynamic scenes while jointly estimating accurate ego motion. Our DynaGSLAM outperforms SOTA static & \"Anti'' dynamic GS-SLAM on three dynamic real datasets, while keeping speed and memory efficiency in practice.",

To address these challenges, we propose EgoSplat, a language-embedded 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for open-vocabulary egocentric scene understanding. A multi-view consistent instance feature aggregation method is designed to leverage the segmentation and tracking capabilities of SAM2 to selectively aggregate complementary features across views for each instance, ensuring precise semantic representation of scenes.

EgoSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in both localization and segmentation tasks on two datasets, outperforming existing methods with a 8.2% improvement in localization accuracy and a 3.7% improvement in segmentation mIoU on the ADT dataset, and setting a new benchmark in open-vocabulary egocentric scene understanding.

Then in practice, we refactor three crucial components through GS, to leverage its explicit scene representation and real-time rendering: (1) choosing the 2D neural Gaussian representation for physics-compliant scene and sensor modeling, (2) proposing a scene editing pipeline to leverage Gaussian primitives library for data augmentation, and (3) coupling a controllable diffusion model for scene expansion and harmonization. We implement this framework on a proprietary autonomous driving dataset supporting cameras and LiDAR sensors. We demonstrate through ablation studies that our approach reduces frame-wise simulation latency, achieves better geometric and photometric consistency, and enables interpretable explicit scene editing and expansion. Furthermore, we showcase how integrating such a GS-based sensor simulator with traffic and dynamic simulators enables full-stack testing of end-to-end autonomy algorithms.

This often leads to convergence at suboptimal local minima, resulting in noticeable structural artifacts in the reconstructed scenes.To mitigate these issues, we propose Uncertainty-aware Normal-Guided Gaussian Splatting (UNG-GS), a novel framework featuring an explicit Spatial Uncertainty Field (SUF) to quantify geometric uncertainty within the 3DGS pipeline. UNG-GS enables high-fidelity rendering and achieves high-precision reconstruction without relying on priors. Specifically, we first integrate Gaussian-based probabilistic modeling into the training of 3DGS to optimize the SUF, providing the model with adaptive error tolerance. An uncertainty-aware depth rendering strategy is then employed to weight depth contributions based on the SUF, effectively reducing noise while preserving fine details. Furthermore, an uncertainty-guided normal refinement method adjusts the influence of neighboring depth values in normal estimation, promoting robust results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNG-GS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both sparse and dense sequences. The code will be open-source.",

Conversely, optimization-based video methods achieve higher fidelity but demand controlled capture conditions and computationally intensive refinement processes. Motivated by the emergence of large reconstruction models for efficient static reconstruction, we propose LHM (Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model) to infer high-fidelity avatars represented as 3D Gaussian splatting in a feed-forward pass. Our model leverages a multimodal transformer architecture to effectively encode the human body positional features and image features with attention mechanism, enabling detailed preservation of clothing geometry and texture. To further boost the face identity preservation and fine detail recovery, we propose a head feature pyramid encoding scheme to aggregate multi-scale features of the head regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LHM generates plausible animatable human in seconds without post-processing for face and hands, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability.",

Isolating individual 3D Gaussian primitives for each object and handling occlusions in scenes remains far from being solved. We propose a novel object extraction method based on two key principles: (1) object-centric reconstruction through removal of irrelevant primitives; and (2) leveraging generative inpainting to compensate for missing observations caused by occlusions. For pruning, we propose to remove irrelevant Gaussians by looking into how close they are to its K-nearest neighbors and removing those that are statistical outliers. Importantly, these distances must take into account the actual spatial extent they cover -- we thus propose to use Wasserstein distances. For inpainting, we employ an off-the-shelf diffusion-based inpainter combined with occlusion reasoning, utilizing the 3D representation of the entire scene. Our findings highlight the crucial synergy between proper pruning and inpainting, both of which significantly enhance extraction performance. We evaluate our method on a standard real-world dataset and introduce a synthetic dataset for quantitative analysis.

As 3DGS is becoming a foundational component of many models, any improvement on 3DGS itself can bring huge benefits. To this end, we aim to improve the fundamental paradigm and formulation of 3DGS. We argue that as an unnormalized mixture model, it needs to be neither Gaussians nor splatting. We subsequently propose a new mixture model consisting of flexible Student's t distributions, with both positive (splatting) and negative (scooping) densities. We name our model Student Splatting and Scooping, or SSS. When providing better expressivity, SSS also poses new challenges in learning. Therefore, we also propose a new principled sampling approach for optimization. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, across multiple datasets, settings, and metrics, we demonstrate that SSS outperforms existing methods in terms of quality and parameter efficiency, e.g. achieving matching or better quality with similar numbers of components, and obtaining comparable results while reducing the component number by as much as 82%.",

We then propose combining the dual LDR rendering results from both 3D and 2D local tone mapping at the loss level.

    "abstract": "Neural reconstruction models for autonomous driving simulation have made significant strides in recent years, with dynamic models becoming increasingly prevalent. However, these models are typically limited to handling in-domain objects closely following their original trajectories. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with physics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based rendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for real-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR simulation.",

    "abstract": "To enable AI agents to interact seamlessly with both humans and 3D environments, they must not only perceive the 3D world accurately but also align human language with 3D spatial representations. While prior work has made significant progress by integrating language features into geometrically detailed 3D scene representations using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), these approaches rely on computationally intensive offline preprocessing of language features for each input image, limiting adaptability to new environments. In this work, we introduce Online Language Splatting, the first framework to achieve online, near real-time, open-vocabulary language mapping within a 3DGS-SLAM system without requiring pre-generated language features. The key challenge lies in efficiently fusing high-dimensional language features into 3D representations while balancing the computation speed, memory usage, rendering quality and open-vocabulary capability. To this end, we innovatively design: (1) a high-resolution CLIP embedding module capable of generating detailed language feature maps in 18ms per frame, (2) a two-stage online auto-encoder that compresses 768-dimensional CLIP features to 15 dimensions while preserving open-vocabulary capabilities, and (3) a color-language disentangled optimization approach to improve rendering quality. Experimental results show that our online method not only surpasses the state-of-the-art offline methods in accuracy but also achieves more than 40x efficiency boost, demonstrating the potential for dynamic and interactive AI applications.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing novel views after training on a given set of viewpoints. However, its rendering quality deteriorates when the synthesized view deviates significantly from the training views. This decline occurs due to (1) the model's difficulty in generalizing to out-of-distribution scenarios and (2) challenges in interpolating fine details caused by substantial resolution changes and occlusions. A notable case of this limitation is close-up view generation--producing views that are significantly closer to the object than those in the training set. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach for close-up view generation based by progressively training the 3DGS model with self-generated data. Our solution is based on three key ideas. First, we leverage the See3D model, a recently introduced 3D-aware generative model, to enhance the details of rendered views. Second, we propose a strategy to progressively expand the ``trust regions'' of the 3DGS model and update a set of reference views for See3D. Finally, we introduce a fine-tuning strategy to carefully update the 3DGS model with training data generated from the above schemes. We further define metrics for close-up views evaluation to facilitate better research on this problem. By conducting evaluations on specifically selected scenarios for close-up views, our proposed approach demonstrates a clear advantage over competitive solutions.",

Specifically, HOGS combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with a physics-aware optimization process.

This combination enables coherent joint rendering of human and object Gaussians while enforcing physically plausible interactions.

However, existing methods primarily rely on implicit motion representations, such as encoding motions into neural networks or per-Gaussian parameters, which makes it difficult to further manipulate the reconstructed motions. This lack of explicit controllability limits existing methods to replaying recorded motions only, which hinders a wider application in robotics. To address this, we propose Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting (MBGS), a novel framework that uses motion graphs as an explicit and sparse motion representation. The motion of a graph's links is propagated to individual Gaussians via dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight painting functions that determine the influence of each link. The motion graphs and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized from input videos via differentiable rendering. Experiments show that MBGS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the highly challenging iPhone dataset while being competitive on HyperNeRF. We demonstrate the application potential of our method in animating novel object poses, synthesizing real robot demonstrations, and predicting robot actions through visual planning.

FPGS, stylizes large-scale 3D scenes with arbitrary, multiple style reference images without additional optimization while preserving multi-view consistency and real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussians. Prior arts required tedious per-style optimization or time-consuming per-scene training stage and were limited to small-scale 3D scenes. FPGS efficiently stylizes large-scale 3D scenes by introducing a style-decomposed 3D feature field, which inherits AdaIN's feed-forward stylization machinery, supporting arbitrary style reference images. Furthermore, FPGS supports multi-reference stylization with the semantic correspondence matching and local AdaIN, which adds diverse user control for 3D scene styles. FPGS also preserves multi-view consistency by applying semantic matching and style transfer processes directly onto queried features in 3D space. In experiments, we demonstrate that FPGS achieves favorable photorealistic quality scene stylization for large-scale static and dynamic 3D scenes with diverse reference images.

While many compression techniques have been proposed, they fail to efficiently utilize existing bitstreams in on-demand applications due to their lack of progressivity, leading to a waste of resource. To address this issue, we propose PCGS (Progressive Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting), which adaptively controls both the quantity and quality of Gaussians (or anchors) to enable effective progressivity for on-demand applications. Specifically, for quantity, we introduce a progressive masking strategy that incrementally incorporates new anchors while refining existing ones to enhance fidelity. For quality, we propose a progressive quantization approach that gradually reduces quantization step sizes to achieve finer modeling of Gaussian attributes. Furthermore, to compact the incremental bitstreams, we leverage existing quantization results to refine probability prediction, improving entropy coding efficiency across progressive levels. Overall, PCGS achieves progressivity while maintaining compression performance comparable to SoTA non-progressive methods. Code available at: github.com/YihangChen-ee/PCGS.",

However, due to the discrete nature and the insufficient material description of point cloud representations, there are ambiguities in distinguishing wire-like and flat surfaces, as well as transparent or reflective objects. To address these issues, we propose Gaussian Splatting (GS) point cloud-based 3D classification. We find that the scale and rotation coefficients in the GS point cloud help characterize surface types. Specifically, wire-like surfaces consist of multiple slender Gaussian ellipsoids, while flat surfaces are composed of a few flat Gaussian ellipsoids. Additionally, the opacity in the GS point cloud represents the transparency characteristics of objects. As a result, ambiguities in point cloud-based 3D classification can be mitigated utilizing GS point cloud as input. To verify the effectiveness of GS point cloud input, we construct the first real-world GS point cloud dataset in the community, which includes 20 categories with 200 objects in each category. Experiments not only validate the superiority of GS point cloud input, especially in distinguishing ambiguous objects, but also demonstrate the generalization ability across different classification methods.",

Neural rendering techniques, which utilize collected raw sensor data to simulate these dynamic environments, have emerged as a leading methodology. While NeRF-based approaches can uniformly represent scenes for rendering data from both camera and LiDAR, they are hindered by slow rendering speeds due to dense sampling. Conversely, Gaussian Splatting-based methods employ Gaussian primitives for scene representation and achieve rapid rendering through rasterization. However, these rasterization-based techniques struggle to accurately model non-linear optical sensors. This limitation restricts their applicability to sensors beyond pinhole cameras. To address these challenges and enable unified representation of dynamic driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, this study proposes a novel hybrid approach. Our method utilizes rasterization for rendering image data while employing Gaussian ray-tracing for LiDAR data rendering. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Finding the ideal placement of these orbitals requires extensive domain knowledge, though, which thus far has prevented widespread adoption. We solve this in a data-driven manner by training a Cartesian tensor network to predict the orbital positions along with orbital coefficients. This is made possible through a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is used to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule while preserving the rotation equivariance of the charge density itself. Inspired by recent successes of Gaussian Splatting in representing densities in space, we are using Gaussian orbitals and predicting their weights and covariance matrices.

However, when applied to large-scale street scenes, existing methods suffer from rapidly escalating per-viewpoint reconstruction costs as scene size increases, leading to significant computational overhead. After revisiting the conventional pipeline, we identify three key factors accounting for this issue: unnecessary local-to-global transformations, excessive 3D-to-2D projections, and inefficient rendering of distant content. To address these challenges, we propose S3R-GS, a 3DGS framework that Streamlines the pipeline for large-scale Street Scene Reconstruction, effectively mitigating these limitations. Moreover, most existing street 3DGS methods rely on ground-truth 3D bounding boxes to separate dynamic and static components, but 3D bounding boxes are difficult to obtain, limiting real-world applicability. To address this, we propose an alternative solution with 2D boxes, which are easier to annotate or can be predicted by off-the-shelf vision foundation models. Such designs together make S3R-GS readily adapt to large, in-the-wild scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S3R-GS enhances rendering quality and significantly accelerates reconstruction. Remarkably, when applied to videos from the challenging Argoverse2 dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art PSNR and SSIM, reducing reconstruction time to below 50%--and even 20%--of competing methods.",

However, when we apply 3DGS to surface reconstruction tasks, especially in environments with dynamic objects and distractors, the method suffers from floating artifacts and color errors due to inconsistency from different viewpoints. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-View Consistency Gaussian Splatting for the domain of Robust Surface Reconstruction (\\textbf{MVGSR}), which takes advantage of lightweight Gaussian models and a {heuristics-guided distractor masking} strategy for robust surface reconstruction in non-static environments. Compared to existing methods that rely on MLPs for distractor segmentation strategies, our approach separates distractors from static scene elements by comparing multi-view feature consistency, allowing us to obtain precise distractor masks early in training. Furthermore, we introduce a pruning measure based on multi-view contributions to reset transmittance, effectively reducing floating artifacts. Finally, a multi-view consistency loss is applied to achieve high-quality performance in surface reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MVGSR achieves competitive geometric accuracy and rendering fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art surface reconstruction algorithms.

Traditional Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM methods are typically limited to small, bounded indoor settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GigaSLAM, the first RGB NeRF / 3DGS-based SLAM framework for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, as demonstrated on the KITTI, KITTI 360, 4 Seasons and A2D2 datasets. Our approach employs a hierarchical sparse voxel map representation, where Gaussians are decoded by neural networks at multiple levels of detail. This design enables efficient, scalable mapping and high-fidelity viewpoint rendering across expansive, unbounded scenes. For front-end tracking, GigaSLAM utilizes a metric depth model combined with epipolar geometry and PnP algorithms to accurately estimate poses, while incorporating a Bag-of-Words-based loop closure mechanism to maintain robust alignment over long trajectories. Consequently, GigaSLAM delivers high-precision tracking and visually faithful rendering on urban outdoor benchmarks, establishing a robust SLAM solution for large-scale, long-term scenarios, and significantly extending the applicability of Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems to unbounded outdoor environments.

We propose to quantify information gain in 3D-GS by reformulating the problem through the lens of optimal experimental design, which is a classical solution widely used in literature. By restructuring information quantification of 3D-GS through optimal experimental design, we arrive at multiple solutions, of which T-Optimality and D-Optimality perform the best quantitatively and qualitatively as measured on two popular datasets.

We design SOGS, an anchor-based 3D-GS technique that introduces second-order anchors to achieve superior rendering quality and reduced anchor features and model size simultaneously. Specifically, SOGS incorporates covariance-based second-order statistics and correlation across feature dimensions to augment features within each anchor, compensating for the reduced feature size and improving rendering quality effectively. In addition, it introduces a selective gradient loss to enhance the optimization of scene textures and scene geometries, leading to high-quality rendering with small anchor features. Extensive experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks show that SOGS achieves superior rendering quality in novel view synthesis with clearly reduced model size.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have revolutionized scene reconstruction, opening new possibilities for 3D steganography by hiding 3D secrets within 3D covers. The key challenge in steganography is ensuring imperceptibility while maintaining high-fidelity reconstruction. However, existing methods often suffer from detectability risks and utilize only suboptimal 3DGS features, limiting their full potential. We propose a novel end-to-end key-secured 3D steganography framework (KeySS) that jointly optimizes a 3DGS model and a key-secured decoder for secret reconstruction. Our approach reveals that Gaussian features contribute unequally to secret hiding. The framework incorporates a key-controllable mechanism enabling multi-secret hiding and unauthorized access prevention, while systematically exploring optimal feature update to balance fidelity and security. To rigorously evaluate steganographic imperceptibility beyond conventional 2D metrics, we introduce 3D-Sinkhorn distance analysis, which quantifies distributional differences between original and steganographic Gaussian parameters in the representation space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both cover and secret reconstruction while maintaining high security levels, advancing the field of 3D steganography.

    "abstract": "By adaptively controlling the density and generating more Gaussians in regions with high-frequency information, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) can better represent scene details. From the signal processing perspective, representing details usually needs more Gaussians with relatively smaller scales. However, 3DGS currently lacks an explicit constraint linking the density and scale of 3D Gaussians across the domain, leading to 3DGS using improper-scale Gaussians to express frequency information, resulting in the loss of accuracy. In this paper, we propose to establish a direct relation between density and scale through the reparameterization of the scaling parameters and ensure the consistency between them via explicit constraints (i.e., density responds well to changes in frequency). Furthermore, we develop a frequency-aware density control strategy, consisting of densification and deletion, to improve representation quality with fewer Gaussians. A dynamic threshold encourages densification in high-frequency regions, while a scale-based filter deletes Gaussians with improper scale.

GS-based rendering for 3D content has gained considerable attention recently. However, there has been limited exploration in directly generating 3D Gaussians compared to traditional generative modeling approaches. The main challenge lies in the complex data structure of GS represented by discrete point clouds with multiple channels. To overcome this challenge, we propose employing the triplane representation, which allows us to represent Gaussian Splatting as an image-like continuous field. This representation effectively encodes both the geometry and texture information, enabling smooth transformation back to Gaussian point clouds and rendering into images by a TriRenderer, with only 2D supervisions. The proposed TriRenderer is fully differentiable, so that the rendering loss can supervise both texture and geometry encoding. Furthermore, the triplane representation can be compressed using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which can subsequently be utilized in latent diffusion to generate 3D objects. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed generation framework can produce high-quality 3D object geometry and rendering results in the text-to-3D task.",

In contrast, this paper proposes `ActiveInitSplat', a novel framework for active selection of training images for proper initialization and training of GS. ActiveInitSplat relies on density and occupancy criteria of the resultant 3D scene representation from the selected 2D images, to ensure that the latter are captured from diverse viewpoints leading to better scene coverage and that the initialized Gaussian functions are well aligned with the actual 3D structure. Numerical tests on well-known simulated and real environments demonstrate the merits of ActiveInitSplat resulting in significant GS rendering performance improvement over passive GS baselines, in the widely adopted LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR metrics.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) approach, which incorporates context and temporal deformation awareness to improve dynamic scene rendering. Specifically, we employ a 2D semantic segmentation foundation model to self-supervise the 4D semantic features of Gaussians, ensuring meaningful contextual embedding. Simultaneously, we track the temporal deformation of each Gaussian across adjacent frames. By aggregating and encoding both semantic and temporal deformation features, each Gaussian is equipped with cues for potential deformation compensation within 3D space, facilitating a more precise representation of dynamic scenes. Experimental results show that our method improves 4DGS's ability to capture fine details in dynamic scene rendering for autonomous driving and outperforms other self-supervised methods in 4D reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting has become a popular technique for various 3D Computer Vision tasks, including novel view synthesis, scene reconstruction, and dynamic scene rendering. However, the challenge of natural-looking object insertion, where the object's appearance seamlessly matches the scene, remains unsolved. In this work, we propose a method, dubbed D3DR, for inserting a 3DGS-parametrized object into 3DGS scenes while correcting its lighting, shadows, and other visual artifacts to ensure consistency, a problem that has not been successfully addressed before. We leverage advances in diffusion models, which, trained on real-world data, implicitly understand correct scene lighting. After inserting the object, we optimize a diffusion-based Delta Denoising Score (DDS)-inspired objective to adjust its 3D Gaussian parameters for proper lighting correction. Utilizing diffusion model personalization techniques to improve optimization quality, our approach ensures seamless object insertion and natural appearance. Finally, we demonstrate the method's effectiveness by comparing it to existing approaches, achieving 0.5 PSNR and 0.15 SSIM improvements in relighting quality.",

Recent advances leveraging implicit neural representation (INR) have achieved great progress by modeling coordinate-to-pixel mappings. However, the efficiency of these methods may suffer from repeated upsampling and decoding, while their reconstruction fidelity and quality are constrained by the intrinsic representational limitations of coordinate-based functions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ContinuousSR framework with a Pixel-to-Gaussian paradigm, which explicitly reconstructs 2D continuous HR signals from LR images using Gaussian Splatting. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming upsampling and decoding, enabling extremely fast arbitrary-scale super-resolution.

However, it falls short when dealing with glossy surfaces, resulting in visible holes in these areas. We find that the reflection discontinuity causes the issue. To fit the jump from diffuse to specular reflection at different viewing angles, depth bias is introduced in the optimized Gaussian primitives. To address that, we first replace the depth distortion loss in 2DGS with a novel depth convergence loss, which imposes a strong constraint on depth continuity. Then, we rectify the depth criterion in determining the actual surface, which fully accounts for all the intersecting Gaussians along the ray. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations across various datasets reveal that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality, with more complete and accurate surfaces than 2DGS.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction coupled with neural rendering techniques have greatly improved the creation of photo-realistic 3D scenes, influencing both academic research and industry applications. The technique of 3D Gaussian Splatting and its variants incorporate the strengths of both primitive-based and volumetric representations, achieving superior rendering quality. While 3D Geometric Scattering (3DGS) and its variants have advanced the field of 3D representation, they fall short in capturing the stochastic properties of non-local structural information during the training process. Additionally, the initialisation of spherical functions in 3DGS-based methods often fails to engage higher-order terms in early training rounds, leading to unnecessary computational overhead as training progresses. Furthermore, current 3DGS-based approaches require training on higher resolution images to render higher resolution outputs, significantly increasing memory demands and prolonging training durations. We introduce StructGS, a framework that enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for improved novel-view synthesis in 3D reconstruction. StructGS innovatively incorporates a patch-based SSIM loss, dynamic spherical harmonics initialisation and a Multi-scale Residual Network (MSRN) to address the above-mentioned limitations, respectively. Our framework significantly reduces computational redundancy, enhances detail capture and supports high-resolution rendering from low-resolution inputs.

However, none of existing methods yet meet the demand due to three main challenges: the absence of predetermined camera parameters, the need for generalizable 3DGS optimization, and the necessity of reducing redundancy. We propose StreamGS, an online generalizable 3DGS reconstruction method for unposed image streams, which progressively transform image streams to 3D Gaussian streams by predicting and aggregating per-frame Gaussians. Our method overcomes the limitation of the initial point reconstruction \\cite{dust3r} in tackling out-of-domain (OOD) issues by introducing a content adaptive refinement. The refinement enhances cross-frame consistency by establishing reliable pixel correspondences between adjacent frames. Such correspondences further aid in merging redundant Gaussians through cross-frame feature aggregation. The density of Gaussians is thereby reduced, empowering online reconstruction by significantly lowering computational and memory costs. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets have demonstrated that StreamGS achieves quality on par with optimization-based approaches but does so 150 times faster, and exhibits superior generalizability in handling OOD scenes.",

Although 3D-GS shows effectiveness in static scenes, their performance significantly degrades in real-world environments due to transient objects, lighting variations, and diverse levels of occlusion. To tackle this, existing methods estimate occluders or transient elements by leveraging pre-trained models or integrating additional transient field pipelines. However, these methods still suffer from two defects: 1) Using semantic features from the Vision Foundation model (VFM) causes additional computational costs. 2) The transient field requires significant memory to handle transient elements with per-view Gaussians and struggles to define clear boundaries for occluders, solely relying on photometric errors. To address these problems, we propose ForestSplats, a novel approach that leverages the deformable transient field and a superpixel-aware mask to efficiently represent transient elements in the 2D scene across unconstrained image collections and effectively decompose static scenes from transient distractors without VFM. We designed the transient field to be deformable, capturing per-view transient elements. Furthermore, we introduce a superpixel-aware mask that clearly defines the boundaries of occluders by considering photometric errors and superpixels. Additionally, we propose uncertainty-aware densification to avoid generating Gaussians within the boundaries of occluders during densification. Through extensive experiments across several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that ForestSplats outperforms existing methods without VFM and shows significant memory efficiency in representing transient elements.",

However, existing methods have limitations: 3D diffusion models are limited by dataset scarcity and the absence of strong pre-trained priors, while 2D diffusion-based approaches struggle with geometric consistency. We propose a method that leverages 2D diffusion models' implicit 3D reasoning ability while ensuring 3D consistency via Gaussian-splatting-based geometric distillation. Specifically, the proposed Gaussian Splatting Decoder enforces 3D consistency by transforming SV3D latent outputs into an explicit 3D representation. Unlike SV3D, which only relies on implicit 2D representations for video generation, Gaussian Splatting explicitly encodes spatial and appearance attributes, enabling multi-view consistency through geometric constraints. These constraints correct view inconsistencies, ensuring robust geometric consistency. As a result, our approach simultaneously generates high-quality, multi-view-consistent images and accurate 3D models, providing a scalable solution for single-image-based 3D generation and bridging the gap between 2D Diffusion diversity and 3D structural coherence. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art multi-view consistency and strong generalization across diverse datasets. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.",

To address these demands, we propose a SecureGS, a secure and efficient 3DGS steganography framework inspired by Scaffold-GS's anchor point design and neural decoding. SecureGS uses a hybrid decoupled Gaussian encryption mechanism to embed offsets, scales, rotations, and RGB attributes of the hidden 3D Gaussian points in anchor point features, retrievable only by authorized users through privacy-preserving neural networks. To further enhance security, we propose a density region-aware anchor growing and pruning strategy that adaptively locates optimal hiding regions without exposing hidden information.

Specifically, we initially divide the video sequence into fixed-length Groups of Pictures (GoP) to allow parallel training and linear scalability with video length. For each GoP, D2GV represents video frames by applying differentiable rasterization to 2D Gaussians, which are deformed from a canonical space into their corresponding timestamps. Notably, leveraging efficient CUDA-based rasterization, D2GV converges fast and decodes at speeds exceeding 400 FPS, while delivering quality that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art INRs. Moreover, we incorporate a learnable pruning and quantization strategy to streamline D2GV into a more compact representation. We demonstrate D2GV's versatility in tasks including video interpolation, inpainting and denoising, underscoring its potential as a promising solution for video representation.

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis (NVS) from multiple captured photos of an object is a widely studied problem. Achieving high quality typically requires dense sampling of input views, which can lead to frustrating manual labor. Manually positioning cameras to maintain an optimal desired distribution can be difficult for humans, and if a good distribution is found, it is not easy to replicate. Additionally, the captured data can suffer from motion blur and defocus due to human error. In this paper, we use a lightweight object capture pipeline to reduce the manual workload and standardize the acquisition setup, with a consumer turntable to carry the object and a tripod to hold the camera. Of course, turntables and gantry systems have been frequently used to automatically capture dense samples under various views and lighting conditions; the key difference is that we use a turntable under natural environment lighting. This way, we can easily capture hundreds of valid images in several minutes without hands-on effort. However, in the object reference frame, the light conditions vary (rotate); this does not match the assumptions of standard NVS methods like 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). We design a neural radiance representation conditioned on light rotations, which addresses this issue and allows rendering with novel light rotations as an additional benefit. We further study the behavior of rotations and find optimal capturing strategies. We demonstrate our pipeline using 3DGS as the underlying framework, achieving higher quality and showcasing the method's potential for novel lighting and harmonization tasks.",

LiGSM constructs joint loss from images and LiDAR point clouds to estimate the poses and optimize their extrinsic parameters, enabling dynamic adaptation to variations in sensor alignment. Furthermore, it leverages LiDAR point clouds to initialize 3DGS, providing a denser and more reliable starting points compared to sparse SfM points. In scene rendering, the framework augments standard image-based supervision with depth maps generated from LiDAR projections, ensuring an accurate scene representation in both geometry and photometry. Experiments on public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that LiGSM outperforms comparative methods in pose tracking and scene rendering.",

    "abstract": "Self-modeling enables robots to build task-agnostic models of their morphology and kinematics based on data that can be automatically collected, with minimal human intervention and prior information, thereby enhancing machine intelligence. Recent research has highlighted the potential of data-driven technology in modeling the morphology and kinematics of robots. However, existing self-modeling methods suffer from either low modeling quality or excessive data acquisition costs. Beyond morphology and kinematics, texture is also a crucial component of robots, which is challenging to model and remains unexplored. In this work, a high-quality, texture-aware, and link-level method is proposed for robot self-modeling. We utilize three-dimensional (3D) Gaussians to represent the static morphology and texture of robots, and cluster the 3D Gaussians to construct neural ellipsoid bones, whose deformations are controlled by the transformation matrices generated by a kinematic neural network. The 3D Gaussians and kinematic neural network are trained using data pairs composed of joint angles, camera parameters and multi-view images without depth information. By feeding the kinematic neural network with joint angles, we can utilize the well-trained model to describe the corresponding morphology, kinematics and texture of robots at the link level, and render robot images from different perspectives with the aid of 3D Gaussian splatting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the established model can be exploited to perform downstream tasks such as motion planning and inverse kinematics.",

In this study, we propose CoMoGaussian, a Continuous Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting that reconstructs precise 3D scenes from motion-blurred images while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Considering the complex motion patterns inherent in real-world camera movements, we predict continuous camera trajectories using neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To ensure accurate modeling, we employ rigid body transformations, preserving the shape and size of the object but rely on the discrete integration of sampled frames. To better approximate the continuous nature of motion blur, we introduce a continuous motion refinement (CMR) transformation that refines rigid transformations by incorporating additional learnable parameters. By revisiting fundamental camera theory and leveraging advanced neural ODE techniques, we achieve precise modeling of continuous camera trajectories, leading to improved reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on benchmark datasets, which include a wide range of motion blur scenarios, from moderate to extreme blur.",

After an initial multi-view scene capture and training phase, POGS uses a single stereo camera to integrate depth estimates along with self-supervised vision encoder features for object pose estimation. POGS supports grasping, reorientation, and natural language-driven manipulation by refining object pose estimates, facilitating sequential object reset operations with human-induced object perturbations and tool servoing, where robots recover tool pose despite tool perturbations of up to 30{\\deg}.

Despite recent progress, these tasks are often addressed independently, with GS-based rendering methods struggling under diverse light conditions and failing to produce accurate surfaces, while GS-based reconstruction methods frequently compromise rendering quality. This raises a central question: must rendering and reconstruction always involve a trade-off? To address this, we propose MGSR, a 2D/3D Mutual-boosted Gaussian splatting for Surface Reconstruction that enhances both rendering quality and 3D reconstruction accuracy. MGSR introduces two branches--one based on 2D-GS and the other on 3D-GS. The 2D-GS branch excels in surface reconstruction, providing precise geometry information to the 3D-GS branch. Leveraging this geometry, the 3D-GS branch employs a geometry-guided illumination decomposition module that captures reflected and transmitted components, enabling realistic rendering under varied light conditions. Using the transmitted component as supervision, the 2D-GS branch also achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction. Throughout the optimization process, the 2D-GS and 3D-GS branches undergo alternating optimization, providing mutual supervision. Prior to this, each branch completes an independent warm-up phase, with an early stopping strategy implemented to reduce computational costs. We evaluate MGSR on a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, at both object and scene levels, demonstrating strong performance in rendering and surface reconstruction.

Existing single RGB-based methods often compromise accuracy due to their reliance on initial pose estimates and susceptibility to rotational ambiguity, while approaches requiring depth sensors or multi-view setups incur significant deployment costs. To address these limitations, we introduce SplatPose, a novel framework that synergizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with a dual-branch neural architecture to achieve high-precision pose estimation using only a single RGB image. Central to our approach is the Dual-Attention Ray Scoring Network (DARS-Net), which innovatively decouples positional and angular alignment through geometry-domain attention mechanisms, explicitly modeling directional dependencies to mitigate rotational ambiguity. Additionally, a coarse-to-fine optimization pipeline progressively refines pose estimates by aligning dense 2D features between query images and 3DGS-synthesized views, effectively correcting feature misalignment and depth errors from sparse ray sampling. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SplatPose achieves state-of-the-art 6-DoF pose estimation accuracy in single RGB settings, rivaling approaches that depend on depth or multi-view images.",

Specifically, we propose two GPU-oriented techniques: hybrid preprocessing and contribution-aware rasterization. Hybrid preprocessing alleviates the GPU compute and memory pressure by reducing the number of irrelevant Gaussians during rendering. The key is to combine our view-dependent scene representation with online filtering. Meanwhile, contribution-aware rasterization improves the GPU utilization at the rasterization stage by prioritizing Gaussians with high contributions while reducing computations for those with low contributions. Both techniques can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS pipelines with minimal fine-tuning. Collectively, our framework achieves 2.6$\\times$ speedup and 32.3\\% model reduction while achieving superior rendering quality compared to existing methods.",

However, reconstructing dynamic scenes such as complex human performances with long durations remains challenging. Prior efforts fall short of modeling a long-term sequence with drastic motions, frequent topology changes or interactions with props, and resort to segmenting the whole sequence into groups of frames that are processed independently, which undermines temporal stability and thereby leads to an unpleasant viewing experience and inefficient storage footprint. In view of this, we introduce EvolvingGS, a two-stage strategy that first deforms the Gaussian model to coarsely align with the target frame, and then refines it with minimal point addition/subtraction, particularly in fast-changing areas. Owing to the flexibility of the incrementally evolving representation, our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both per-frame and temporal quality metrics while maintaining fast rendering through its purely explicit representation. Moreover, by exploiting temporal coherence between successive frames, we propose a simple yet effective compression algorithm that achieves over 50x compression rate. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and challenging custom datasets demonstrate that our method significantly advances the state-of-the-art in dynamic scene reconstruction, particularly for extended sequences with complex human performances.",

In this work, we address two critical yet overlooked issues in real-world sparse-input modeling: extrapolation and occlusion. To tackle these issues, we propose to use a reconstruction by generation pipeline that leverages learned priors from video diffusion models to provide plausible interpretations for regions outside the field of view or occluded. However, the generated sequences exhibit inconsistencies that do not fully benefit subsequent 3DGS modeling. To address the challenge of inconsistencies, we introduce a novel scene-grounding guidance based on rendered sequences from an optimized 3DGS, which tames the diffusion model to generate consistent sequences. This guidance is training-free and does not require any fine-tuning of the diffusion model. To facilitate holistic scene modeling, we also propose a trajectory initialization method. It effectively identifies regions that are outside the field of view and occluded. We further design a scheme tailored for 3DGS optimization with generated sequences. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves upon the baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.",

To this end, we propose a novel Sparse-view Super-resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, dubbed S2Gaussian, that can reconstruct structure-accurate and detail-faithful 3D scenes with only sparse and low-resolution views. The S2Gaussian operates in a two-stage fashion. In the first stage, we initially optimize a low-resolution Gaussian representation with depth regularization and densify it to initialize the high-resolution Gaussians through a tailored Gaussian Shuffle Split operation. In the second stage, we refine the high-resolution Gaussians with the super-resolved images generated from both original sparse views and pseudo-views rendered by the low-resolution Gaussians. In which a customized blur-free inconsistency modeling scheme and a 3D robust optimization strategy are elaborately designed to mitigate multi-view inconsistency and eliminate erroneous updates caused by imperfect supervision.

    "abstract": "Real2Sim is becoming increasingly important with the rapid development of surgical artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomy. In this work, we propose a novel Real2Sim methodology, Instrument-Splatting, that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to provide fully controllable 3D reconstruction of surgical instruments from monocular surgical videos. To maintain both high visual fidelity and manipulability, we introduce a geometry pre-training to bind Gaussian point clouds on part mesh with accurate geometric priors and define a forward kinematics to control the Gaussians as flexible as real instruments. Afterward, to handle unposed videos, we design a novel instrument pose tracking method leveraging semantics-embedded Gaussians to robustly refine per-frame instrument poses and joint states in a render-and-compare manner, which allows our instrument Gaussian to accurately learn textures and reach photorealistic rendering. We validated our method on 2 publicly released surgical videos and 4 videos collected on ex vivo tissues and green screens. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has significantly advanced 3D reconstruction by providing high fidelity and fast training speeds across various scenarios. While recent efforts have mainly focused on improving model structures to compress data volume or reduce artifacts during zoom-in and zoom-out operations, they often overlook an underlying issue: training sampling deficiency. In zoomed-in views, Gaussian primitives can appear unregulated and distorted due to their dilation limitations and the insufficient availability of scale-specific training samples. Consequently, incorporating pseudo-details that ensure the completeness and alignment of the scene becomes essential. In this paper, we introduce a new training method that integrates diffusion models and multi-scale training using pseudo-ground-truth data. This approach not only notably mitigates the dilation and zoomed-in artifacts but also enriches reconstructed scenes with precise details out of existing scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks and extends the capabilities of 3D reconstruction beyond training datasets.",

However existing RL methods suffer from high sample complexity, poor sim-to-real transfer, and limited runtime adaptability to navigation scenarios not seen during training. These problems are particularly challenging for drones, with complex nonlinear and unstable dynamics, and strong dynamic coupling between control and perception. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with differentiable deep reinforcement learning (DDRL) to train vision-based drone navigation policies. By leveraging high-fidelity 3D scene representations and differentiable simulation, our method improves sample efficiency and sim-to-real transfer. Additionally, we incorporate a Context-aided Estimator Network (CENet) to adapt to environmental variations at runtime. Moreover, by curriculum training in a mixture of different surrounding environments, we achieve in-task generalization, the ability to solve new instances of a task not seen during training. Drone hardware experiments demonstrate our method's high training efficiency compared to state-of-the-art RL methods, zero shot sim-to-real transfer for real robot deployment without fine tuning, and ability to adapt to new instances within the same task class (e.g. to fly through a gate at different locations with different distractors in the environment).

In contrast, previous approaches based on sparse feature fields either suffer from inefficiencies due to multi-view dependencies and extensive training or lack sufficient grasp dexterity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Language-ENhanced Sparse Distilled Feature Field (LensDFF), which efficiently distills view-consistent 2D features onto 3D points using our novel language-enhanced feature fusion strategy, thereby enabling single-view few-shot generalization.

Stylized worlds can also be used for downstream tasks where there is limited training data and a need to expand a model's training distribution. Most current novel-view synthesis stylization techniques lack the ability to convincingly change geometry. This is because any geometry change requires increased style strength which is often capped for stylization stability and consistency. In this work, we propose a new autoregressive 3D Gaussian Splatting stylization method. As part of this method, we contribute a new RGBD diffusion model that allows for strength control over appearance and shape stylization. To ensure consistency across stylized frames, we use a combination of novel depth-guided cross attention, feature injection, and a Warp ControlNet conditioned on composite frames for guiding the stylization of new frames. We validate our method via extensive qualitative results, quantitative experiments, and a user study. Code online.",

At the core of our approach is Difix, a single-step image diffusion model trained to enhance and remove artifacts in rendered novel views caused by underconstrained regions of the 3D representation. Difix serves two critical roles in our pipeline. First, it is used during the reconstruction phase to clean up pseudo-training views that are rendered from the reconstruction and then distilled back into 3D. This greatly enhances underconstrained regions and improves the overall 3D representation quality. More importantly, Difix also acts as a neural enhancer during inference, effectively removing residual artifacts arising from imperfect 3D supervision and the limited capacity of current reconstruction models. Difix3D+ is a general solution, a single model compatible with both NeRF and 3DGS representations, and it achieves an average 2$\\times$ improvement in FID score over baselines while maintaining 3D consistency.",

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention for its high-quality rendering and fast inference speed. Yet, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds, ensuring accurate geometry reconstruction remains difficult. Existing methods primarily focus on geometry regularization, with common approaches including primitive-based and dual-model frameworks. However, the former suffers from inherent conflicts between rendering and reconstruction, while the latter is computationally and storage-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose CarGS, a unified model leveraging Contribution-adaptive regularization to achieve simultaneous, high-quality rendering and surface reconstruction. The essence of our framework is learning adaptive contribution for Gaussian primitives by squeezing the knowledge from geometry regularization into a compact MLP. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-guided densification strategy with clues from both normals and Signed Distance Fields (SDF) to improve the capability of capturing high-frequency details. Our design improves the mutual learning of the two tasks, meanwhile its unified structure does not require separate models as in dual-model based approaches, guaranteeing efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the ability to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in both rendering fidelity and reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time speed and minimal storage size.",

    "abstract": "The generation of 3D content from single-view images has been extensively studied, but 3D dynamic scene generation with physical consistency from videos remains in its early stages. We propose a novel framework leveraging generative 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models to extract 3D dynamic fluid objects from single-view videos. The fluid geometry represented by 3DGS is initially generated from single-frame images, then denoised, densified, and aligned across frames. We estimate the fluid surface velocity using optical flow and compute the mainstream of the fluid to refine it. The 3D volumetric velocity field is then derived from the enclosed surface. The velocity field is then converted into a divergence-free, grid-based representation, enabling the optimization of simulation parameters through its differentiability across frames. This process results in simulation-ready fluid assets with physical dynamics closely matching those observed in the source video. Our approach is applicable to various fluid types, including gas, liquid, and viscous fluids, and allows users to edit the output geometry or extend movement durations seamlessly. Our automatic method for creating 3D dynamic fluid assets from single-view videos, easily obtainable from the internet, shows great potential for generating large-scale 3D fluid assets at a low cost.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) achieves impressive results in novel view synthesis for small, single-object scenes through Gaussian ellipsoid initialization and adaptive density control. However, when applied to large-scale remote sensing scenes, 3D GS faces challenges: the point clouds generated by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) are often sparse, and the inherent smoothing behavior of 3D GS leads to over-reconstruction in high-frequency regions, where have detailed textures and color variations. This results in the generation of large, opaque Gaussian ellipsoids that cause gradient artifacts. Moreover, the simultaneous optimization of both geometry and texture may lead to densification of Gaussian ellipsoids at incorrect geometric locations, resulting in artifacts in other views. To address these issues, we propose PSRGS, a progressive optimization scheme based on spectral residual maps. Specifically, we create a spectral residual significance map to separate low-frequency and high-frequency regions. In the low-frequency region, we apply depth-aware and depth-smooth losses to initialize the scene geometry with low threshold. For the high-frequency region, we use gradient features with higher threshold to split and clone ellipsoids, refining the scene. The sampling rate is determined by feature responses and gradient loss. Finally, we introduce a pre-trained network that jointly computes perceptual loss from multiple views, ensuring accurate restoration of high-frequency details in both Gaussian ellipsoids geometry and color. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets to assess the effectiveness of our method, which demonstrates competitive rendering quality, especially in recovering texture details in high-frequency regions.",

However, 3D-GS and its variants assume that input images are captured based on pinhole imaging and are fully in focus. This assumption limits their applicability, as real-world images often feature shallow depth-of-field (DoF). In this paper, we introduce DoF-Gaussian, a controllable depth-of-field method for 3D-GS. We develop a lens-based imaging model based on geometric optics principles to control DoF effects. To ensure accurate scene geometry, we incorporate depth priors adjusted per scene, and we apply defocus-to-focus adaptation to minimize the gap in the circle of confusion. We also introduce a synthetic dataset to assess refocusing capabilities and the model's ability to learn precise lens parameters. Our framework is customizable and supports various interactive applications. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Existing research on copyright protection for generative models has primarily concentrated on watermarking in image and text modalities, with little exploration into the copyright protection of 3D object generative models. In this paper, we propose the first bit watermarking framework for 3DGS generative models, named GaussianSeal, to enable the decoding of bits as copyright identifiers from the rendered outputs of generated 3DGS. By incorporating adaptive bit modulation modules into the generative model and embedding them into the network blocks in an adaptive way, we achieve high-precision bit decoding with minimal training overhead while maintaining the fidelity of the model's outputs.

However, the needs to compress and transmit the 3DGS representation to the remote side are overlooked. This new application calls for rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression. How to quantize and entropy encode sparse Gaussian primitives in the 3D space remains largely unexplored. Few early attempts resort to the hyperprior framework from learned image compression. But, they fail to utilize fully the inter and intra correlation inherent in Gaussian primitives. Built on ScaffoldGS, this work, termed CAT-3DGS, introduces a context-adaptive triplane approach to their rate-distortion-optimized coding. It features multi-scale triplanes, oriented according to the principal axes of Gaussian primitives in the 3D space, to capture their inter correlation (i.e. spatial correlation) for spatial autoregressive coding in the projected 2D planes. With these triplanes serving as the hyperprior, we further perform channel-wise autoregressive coding to leverage the intra correlation within each individual Gaussian primitive. Our CAT-3DGS incorporates a view frequency-aware masking mechanism. It actively skips from coding those Gaussian primitives that potentially have little impact on the rendering quality. When trained end-to-end to strike a good rate-distortion trade-off, our CAT-3DGS achieves the state-of-the-art compression performance on the commonly used real-world datasets.",

The resulting abstract image-which encodes an infinite collection of possible renderings-is represented using constraints on the image matrix, enabling rigorous uncertainty propagation through the rendering process. This capability is particularly valuable for the formal verification of vision-based autonomous systems and other safety-critical applications. Our approach operates on Gaussian splat scenes, an emerging representation in computer vision and robotics. We leverage efficient piecewise linear bound propagation to abstract fundamental rendering operations, while addressing key challenges that arise in matrix inversion and depth sorting-two operations not directly amenable to standard approximations. To handle these, we develop novel linear relational abstractions that maintain precision while ensuring computational efficiency. These abstractions not only power our abstract rendering algorithm but also provide broadly applicable tools for other rendering problems. Our implementation, AbstractSplat, is optimized for scalability, handling up to 750k Gaussians while allowing users to balance memory and runtime through tile and batch-based computation. Compared to the only existing abstract image method for mesh-based scenes, AbstractSplat achieves 2-14x speedups while preserving precision. Our results demonstrate that continuous camera motion, rotations, and scene variations can be rigorously analyzed at scale, making abstract rendering a powerful tool for uncertainty-aware vision applications.",

Despite the popularity of Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting in the general computer vision community, these systems have yet to find consistent success in surgical scenes due to challenges such as non-stationary lighting and non-Lambertian surfaces. As a result, the need for labeled surgical datasets continues to grow. In this work, we introduce a differentiable rendering framework for material and lighting estimation from endoscopic images and known geometry. Compared to previous approaches that model lighting and material jointly as radiance, we explicitly disentangle these scene properties for robust and photorealistic novel view synthesis. To disambiguate the training process, we formulate domain-specific properties inherent in surgical scenes. Specifically, we model the scene lighting as a simple spotlight and material properties as a bidirectional reflectance distribution function, parameterized by a neural network. By grounding color predictions in the rendering equation, we can generate photorealistic images at arbitrary camera poses. We evaluate our method with various sequences from the Colonoscopy 3D Video Dataset and show that our method produces competitive novel view synthesis results compared with other approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that synthetic data can be used to develop 3D vision algorithms by finetuning a depth estimation model with our rendered outputs. Overall, we see that the depth estimation performance is on par with fine-tuning with the original real images.",

    "abstract": "Rendering dynamic scenes from monocular videos is a crucial yet challenging task. The recent deformable Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a robust solution to represent real-world dynamic scenes. However, it often leads to heavily redundant Gaussians, attempting to fit every training view at various time steps, leading to slower rendering speeds. Additionally, the attributes of Gaussians in static areas are time-invariant, making it unnecessary to model every Gaussian, which can cause jittering in static regions. In practice, the primary bottleneck in rendering speed for dynamic scenes is the number of Gaussians. In response, we introduce Efficient Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (EDGS), which represents dynamic scenes via sparse time-variant attribute modeling. Our approach formulates dynamic scenes using a sparse anchor-grid representation, with the motion flow of dense Gaussians calculated via a classical kernel representation. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised strategy to efficiently filter out anchors corresponding to static areas. Only anchors associated with deformable objects are input into MLPs to query time-variant attributes. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our EDGS significantly improves the rendering speed with superior rendering quality compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "3D part segmentation is still an open problem in the field of 3D vision and AR/VR. Due to limited 3D labeled data, traditional supervised segmentation methods fall short in generalizing to unseen shapes and categories. Recently, the advancement in vision-language models' zero-shot abilities has brought a surge in open-world 3D segmentation methods. While these methods show promising results for 3D scenes or objects, they do not generalize well to 3D humans. In this paper, we present the first open-vocabulary segmentation method capable of handling 3D human. Our framework can segment the human category into desired fine-grained parts based on the textual prompt. We design a simple segmentation pipeline, leveraging SAM to generate multi-view proposals in 2D and proposing a novel HumanCLIP model to create unified embeddings for visual and textual inputs. Compared with existing pre-trained CLIP models, the HumanCLIP model yields more accurate embeddings for human-centric contents. We also design a simple-yet-effective MaskFusion module, which classifies and fuses multi-view features into 3D semantic masks without complex voting and grouping mechanisms. The design of decoupling mask proposals and text input also significantly boosts the efficiency of per-prompt inference. Experimental results on various 3D human datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation methods by a large margin. In addition, we show that our method can be directly applied to various 3D representations including meshes, point clouds, and 3D Gaussian Splatting.",

    "abstract": "Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become an important reference method for learning 3D representations of a captured scene, allowing real-time novel-view synthesis with high visual quality and fast training times. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which preceded 3DGS, are based on a principled ray-marching approach for volumetric rendering. In contrast, while sharing a similar image formation model with NeRF, 3DGS uses a hybrid rendering solution that builds on the strengths of volume rendering and primitive rasterization. A crucial benefit of 3DGS is its performance, achieved through a set of approximations, in many cases with respect to volumetric rendering theory. A naturally arising question is whether replacing these approximations with more principled volumetric rendering solutions can improve the quality of 3DGS. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of the various approximations and assumptions used by the original 3DGS solution. We demonstrate that, while more accurate volumetric rendering can help for low numbers of primitives, the power of efficient optimization and the large number of Gaussians allows 3DGS to outperform volumetric rendering despite its approximations.",

Unlike traditional neural radiance field (NeRF) methods, which typically rely on implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values, 3DGS utilizes millions of learnable 3D Gaussians. Its differentiable rendering technique and inherent capability for explicit scene representation and manipulation positions 3DGS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation technologies. This enables 3DGS to deliver real-time rendering speeds while offering unparalleled editability levels. However, despite its advantages, 3DGS suffers from substantial memory and storage requirements, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview focusing on the scalability and compression of 3DGS. We begin with a detailed background overview of 3DGS, followed by a structured taxonomy of existing compression methods. Additionally, we analyze and compare current methods from the topological perspective, evaluating their strengths and limitations in terms of fidelity, compression ratios, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we explore how advancements in efficient NeRF representations can inspire future developments in 3DGS optimization. Finally, we conclude with current research challenges and highlight key directions for future exploration.",

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multi-modal 3D pre-training methods have shown promising efficacy in learning joint representations of text, images, and point clouds. However, adopting point clouds as 3D representation fails to fully capture the intricacies of the 3D world and exhibits a noticeable gap between the discrete points and the dense 2D pixels of images. To tackle this issue, we propose UniGS, integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into multi-modal pre-training to enhance the 3D representation. We first rely on the 3DGS representation to model the 3D world as a collection of 3D Gaussians with color and opacity, incorporating all the information of the 3D scene while establishing a strong connection with 2D images. Then, to achieve Language-Image-3D pertaining, UniGS starts with a pre-trained vision-language model to establish a shared visual and textual space through extensive real-world image-text pairs. Subsequently, UniGS employs a 3D encoder to align the optimized 3DGS with the Language-Image representations to learn unified multi-modal representations. To facilitate the extraction of global explicit 3D features by the 3D encoder and achieve better cross-modal alignment, we additionally introduce a novel Gaussian-Aware Guidance module that guides the learning of fine-grained representations of the 3D domain. Through extensive experiments across the Objaverse, ABO, MVImgNet and SUN RGBD datasets with zero-shot classification, text-driven retrieval and open-world understanding tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of UniGS in learning a more general and stronger aligned multi-modal representation. Specifically, UniGS achieves leading results across different 3D tasks with remarkable improvements over previous SOTA, Uni3D, including on zero-shot classification (+9.36%), text-driven retrieval (+4.3%) and open-world understanding (+7.92%).",

It is observed existing methods have various limitations, such as requiring precise camera poses for input and dense viewpoints for supervision. To perform effective and efficient 3D scene reconstruction, we propose a novel graph-guided 3D scene reconstruction framework, GraphGS. Specifically, given a set of images captured by RGB cameras on a scene, we first design a spatial prior-based scene structure estimation method. This is then used to create a camera graph that includes information about the camera topology. Further, we propose to apply the graph-guided multi-view consistency constraint and adaptive sampling strategy to the 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization process. This greatly alleviates the issue of Gaussian points overfitting to specific sparse viewpoints and expedites the 3D reconstruction process. We demonstrate GraphGS achieves high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from images, which presents state-of-the-art performance through quantitative and qualitative evaluation across multiple datasets.

Our efficient model architecture based on a Gaussian Transformer significantly reduces computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need for expensive 3D convolutions used with inefficient voxel-based representations that predominantly represent empty 3D spaces. GaussianFlowOcc effectively captures scene dynamics by estimating temporal flow for each Gaussian during the overall network training process, offering a straightforward solution to a complex problem that is often neglected by existing methods. Moreover, GaussianFlowOcc is designed for scalability, as it employs weak supervision and does not require costly dense 3D voxel annotations based on additional data (e.g., LiDAR). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that GaussianFlowOcc significantly outperforms all previous methods for weakly supervised occupancy estimation on the nuScenes dataset while featuring an inference speed that is 50 times faster than current SOTA.",

    "abstract": "With the rising popularity of 3D Gaussian splatting and the expanse of applications from rendering to 3D reconstruction, there comes also a need for geometry processing applications directly on this new representation. While considering the centers of Gaussians as a point cloud or meshing them is an option that allows to apply existing algorithms, this might ignore information present in the data or be unnecessarily expensive. Additionally, Gaussian splatting tends to contain a large number of outliers which do not affect the rendering quality but need to be handled correctly in order not to produce noisy results in geometry processing applications. In this work, we propose a formulation to compute the Laplace-Beltrami operator, a widely used tool in geometry processing, directly on Gaussian splatting using the Mahalanobis distance. While conceptually similar to a point cloud Laplacian, our experiments show superior accuracy on the point clouds encoded in the Gaussian splatting centers and, additionally, the operator can be used to evaluate the quality of the output during optimization.",

First, we introduce native hardware support for early termination by repurposing existing special-purpose hardware in modern GPUs. Second, we propose multi-granular tile binning with quad merging, which opportunistically blends fragments in shader cores before passing them to fixed-function blending units. Our evaluation shows that VR-Pipe greatly improves rendering performance, achieving up to a 2.78x speedup over the conventional graphics pipeline with negligible hardware overhead.",

We introduce the Anchor-Gaussian Variational Autoencoder (Anchor-GS VAE), which encodes a point cloud and a single image into anchor latents and decode these latents into 3DGS, enabling efficient latent-space generation. To enable multi-view geometry consistent and controllable generation, we propose a Seed-Point-Driven strategy: first generate sparse seed points as a coarse geometry representation, then map them to anchor latents via the Seed-Anchor Mapping Module. Geometric consistency is ensured by the easily learned sparse seed points, and users can intuitively drag the seed points to deform the final 3DGS geometry, with changes propagated through the anchor latents. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve geometrically controllable 3D Gaussian generation and editing without relying on 2D diffusion priors, delivering comparable 3D generation quality to state-of-the-art methods.",

Technically, we first employ a pointmap regression network to generate consistent pointmaps between frames for pose estimation. Compared to commonly used depth maps, pointmaps include spatial relationships and scene geometry across multiple views, enabling robust camera pose estimation. Then, we propose integrating the estimated camera poses with 3DGS rendering as an end-to-end differentiable pipeline. Our method achieves simultaneous optimization of camera poses and 3DGS scene parameters, significantly enhancing system tracking accuracy. Specifically, we also design an adaptive scale mapper for the pointmap regression network, which provides more accurate pointmap mapping to the 3DGS map representation. Our experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that OpenGS-SLAM reduces tracking error to 9.8\\% of previous 3DGS methods, and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis.

    "abstract": "In real-world scenarios, environment changes caused by human or agent activities make it extremely challenging for robots to perform various long-term tasks. Recent works typically struggle to effectively understand and adapt to dynamic environments due to the inability to update their environment representations in memory according to environment changes and lack of fine-grained reconstruction of the environments. To address these challenges, we propose DynamicGSG, a dynamic, high-fidelity, open-vocabulary scene graph construction system leveraging Gaussian splatting. DynamicGSG builds hierarchical scene graphs using advanced vision language models to represent the spatial and semantic relationships between objects in the environments, utilizes a joint feature loss we designed to supervise Gaussian instance grouping while optimizing the Gaussian maps, and locally updates the Gaussian scene graphs according to real environment changes for long-term environment adaptation. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the performance and efficacy of our proposed method in terms of semantic segmentation, language-guided object retrieval, and reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we validate the dynamic updating capabilities of our system in real laboratory environments.

However, its geometric accuracy in 3D reconstruction remains limited due to the lack of explicit geometric constraints during optimization. This paper introduces CDGS, a confidence-aware depth regularization approach developed to enhance 3DGS. We leverage multi-cue confidence maps of monocular depth estimation and sparse Structure-from-Motion depth to adaptively adjust depth supervision during the optimization process. Our method demonstrates improved geometric detail preservation in early training stages and achieves competitive performance in both NVS quality and geometric accuracy. Experiments on the publicly available Tanks and Temples benchmark dataset show that our method achieves more stable convergence behavior and more accurate geometric reconstruction results, with improvements of up to 2.31 dB in PSNR for NVS and consistently lower geometric errors in M3C2 distance metrics. Notably, our method reaches comparable F-scores to the original 3DGS with only 50% of the training iterations. We expect this work will facilitate the development of efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction systems for real-world applications such as digital twin creation, heritage preservation, or forestry applications.",

To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce an advanced semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both Intra-level and Inter-level optimizations. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantic monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM system, significantly reducing sensor requirements for 3D semantic understanding and broadening the applicability of semantic Gaussian SLAM system.

To address these challenges, we propose OG-Gaussian, a novel approach that replaces LiDAR point clouds with Occupancy Grids (OGs) generated from surround-view camera images using Occupancy Prediction Network (ONet). Our method leverages the semantic information in OGs to separate dynamic vehicles from static street background, converting these grids into two distinct sets of initial point clouds for reconstructing both static and dynamic objects. Additionally, we estimate the trajectories and poses of dynamic objects through a learning-based approach, eliminating the need for complex manual annotations. Experiments on Waymo Open dataset demonstrate that OG-Gaussian is on par with the current state-of-the-art in terms of reconstruction quality and rendering speed, achieving an average PSNR of 35.13 and a rendering speed of 143 FPS, while significantly reducing computational costs and economic overhead.",

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of 3D objects from calibrated photographs represents a fundamental yet intricate challenge in the domains of computer graphics and vision. Although neural reconstruction approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable capabilities, their processing costs remain substantial. Recently, the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) largely improves the training efficiency and facilitates to generate realistic rendering in real-time. However, due to the limited ability of Spherical Harmonics (SH) to represent high-frequency information, 3D-GS falls short in reconstructing glossy objects. Researchers have turned to enhance the specular expressiveness of 3D-GS through inverse rendering. Yet these methods often struggle to maintain the training and rendering efficiency, undermining the benefits of Gaussian Splatting techniques. In this paper, we introduce GlossGau, an efficient inverse rendering framework that reconstructs scenes with glossy surfaces while maintaining training and rendering speeds comparable to vanilla 3D-GS. Specifically, we explicitly model the surface normals, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) parameters, as well as incident lights and use Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) to approximate the per-Gaussian Normal Distribution Function under the microfacet model. We utilize 2D Gaussian Splatting (2D-GS) as foundational primitives and apply regularization to significantly alleviate the normal estimation challenge encountered in related works. Experiments demonstrate that GlossGau achieves competitive or superior reconstruction on datasets with glossy surfaces. Compared with previous GS-based works that address the specular surface, our optimization time is considerably less.",

To alleviate the impractical constraints on camera trajectories across training states, we propose a Mutual State Regularization mechanism to enhance the spatial density consistency of movable parts.

Current prediction methods are limited by training and storage efficiency, mainly focusing on 2D spatial predictions at specific altitudes. Meanwhile, 3D volumetric predictions at each timestamp remain largely unexplored. To address such a challenge, we introduce a comprehensive framework for 3D radar sequence prediction in weather nowcasting, using the newly proposed SpatioTemporal Coherent Gaussian Splatting (STC-GS) for dynamic radar representation and GauMamba for efficient and accurate forecasting. Specifically, rather than relying on a 4D Gaussian for dynamic scene reconstruction, STC-GS optimizes 3D scenes at each frame by employing a group of Gaussians while effectively capturing their movements across consecutive frames. It ensures consistent tracking of each Gaussian over time, making it particularly effective for prediction tasks. With the temporally correlated Gaussian groups established, we utilize them to train GauMamba, which integrates a memory mechanism into the Mamba framework. This allows the model to learn the temporal evolution of Gaussian groups while efficiently handling a large volume of Gaussian tokens. As a result, it achieves both efficiency and accuracy in forecasting a wide range of dynamic meteorological radar signals. The experimental results demonstrate that our STC-GS can efficiently represent 3D radar sequences with over $16\\times$ higher spatial resolution compared with the existing 3D representation methods, while GauMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting a broad spectrum of high-dynamic weather conditions.",

We propose two techniques during the reconstruction phase: a geometry-aware regularization loss function to improve the shape quality and a region-aware feature contrastive loss function to promote region affinity. Two other new techniques are designed during inference: a feature-based property propagation module and a volume integration module tailored for the Gaussian representation.

    "abstract": "When performing 3D inpainting using novel-view rendering methods like Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), how to achieve texture and geometry consistency across camera views has been a challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework of 3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency (3DGIC) for cross-view consistent 3D inpainting. Guided by the rendered depth information from each training view, our 3DGIC exploits background pixels visible across different views for updating the inpainting mask, allowing us to refine the 3DGS for inpainting purposes.Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we confirm that our 3DGIC outperforms current state-of-the-art 3D inpainting methods quantitatively and qualitatively.",

    "abstract": "Dataflow-oriented spatial architectures are the emerging paradigm for higher computation performance and efficiency.   AMD Versal AI Engine is a commercial spatial architecture consisting of tiles of VLIW processors supporting SIMD operations arranged in a two-dimensional mesh.   The architecture requires the explicit design of task assignments and dataflow configurations for each tile to maximize performance, demanding advanced techniques and meticulous design.   However, a few works revealed the performance characteristics of the Versal AI Engine through practical workloads.   In this work, we provide the comprehensive performance evaluation of the Versal AI Engine using Gaussian feature computation in 3D Gaussian splatting as a practical workload, and we then propose a novel dedicated algorithm to fully exploit the hardware architecture.   The computations of 3D Gaussian splatting include matrix multiplications and color computations utilizing high-dimensional spherical harmonic coefficients.   These tasks are processed efficiently by leveraging the SIMD capabilities and their instruction-level parallelism.   Additionally, pipelined processing is achieved by assigning different tasks to individual cores, thereby fully exploiting the spatial parallelism of AI Engines.   The proposed method demonstrated a 226-fold throughput increase in simulation-based evaluation, outperforming a naive approach.   These findings provide valuable insights for application development that effectively harnesses the spatial and architectural advantages of AI Engines.",

Although existing methods achieve reasonable text-to-3D generation of human bodies using various 3D representations, they often face limitations in fidelity and efficiency, or primarily focus on static models with limited pose control. In contrast, our method generates fully animatable 3D avatars by combining deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting with text-to-3D score distillation, achieving high fidelity and efficient rendering for arbitrary poses. By densely generating diverse random poses during optimization, our deformable 3D human model learns to capture a wide range of natural motions distilled from a pose-conditioned diffusion model in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Score Distillation that effectively balances realistic detail and smoothness to achieve optimal 3D results. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines by producing high-quality textures in both static and animated results, and by generating diverse 3D human models from various textual inputs.",

Recent advances in neural rendering enable photo-realistic and plausible inverse rendering results. The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has boosted it to the next level by showing real-time rendering potentials. An intuitive finding is that the models used for inverse rendering do not take into account the dependency of opacity w.r.t. material properties, namely cross section, as suggested by optics. Therefore, we develop a novel approach that adds this dependency to the modeling itself. Inspired by radiative transfer, we augment the opacity term by introducing a neural network that takes as input material properties to provide modeling of cross section and a physically correct activation function. The gradients for material properties are therefore not only from color but also from opacity, facilitating a constraint for their optimization. Therefore, the proposed method incorporates more accurate physical properties compared to previous works. We implement our method into 3 different baselines that use Gaussian Splatting for inverse rendering and achieve significant improvements universally in terms of novel view synthesis and material modeling.",

While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.",

Training to get a 3DGS scene often takes a lot of time and resources and even valuable inspiration. The increasing amount of 3DGS digital asset have brought great challenges to the copyright protection. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. In this paper, we propose a new framework X-SG$^2$S which can simultaneously watermark 1 to 3D messages while keeping the original 3DGS scene almost unchanged. Generally, we have a X-SG$^2$S injector for adding multi-modal messages simultaneously and an extractor for extract them. Specifically, we first split the watermarks into message patches in a fixed manner and sort the 3DGS points. A self-adaption gate is used to pick out suitable location for watermarking. Then use a XD(multi-dimension)-injection heads to add multi-modal messages into sorted 3DGS points. A learnable gate can recognize the location with extra messages and XD-extraction heads can restore hidden messages from the location recommended by the learnable gate. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed X-SG$^2$S can effectively conceal multi modal messages without changing pretrained 3DGS pipeline or the original form of 3DGS parameters. Meanwhile, with simple and efficient model structure and high practicality, X-SG$^2$S still shows good performance in hiding and extracting multi-modal inner structured or unstructured messages. X-SG$^2$S is the first to unify 1 to 3D watermarking model for 3DGS and the first framework to add multi-modal watermarks simultaneous in one 3DGS which pave the wave for later researches.",

This avatar is projected onto a stereoscopic, view-dependent 3D display, offering a more immersive and realistic simulated patient experience for pain assessment practice.

To address this limitation, we introduce MeshSplats, a method which converts GS to a mesh-like format. Following the completion of training, MeshSplats transforms Gaussian elements into mesh faces, enabling rendering using ray tracing methods with all their associated benefits. Our model can be utilized immediately following transformation, yielding a mesh of slightly reduced quality without additional training. Furthermore, we can enhance the reconstruction quality through the application of a dedicated optimization algorithm that operates on mesh faces rather than Gaussian components.

However, its optimization process lacks explicit geometric constraints, leading to suboptimal geometric reconstruction in regions with sparse or no observational input views. In this work, we try to mitigate the issue by incorporating a pre-trained matching prior to the 3DGS optimization process. We introduce Flow Distillation Sampling (FDS), a technique that leverages pre-trained geometric knowledge to bolster the accuracy of the Gaussian radiance field. Our method employs a strategic sampling technique to target unobserved views adjacent to the input views, utilizing the optical flow calculated from the matching model (Prior Flow) to guide the flow analytically calculated from the 3DGS geometry (Radiance Flow). Comprehensive experiments in depth rendering, mesh reconstruction, and novel view synthesis showcase the significant advantages of FDS over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our interpretive experiments and analysis aim to shed light on the effects of FDS on geometric accuracy and rendering quality, potentially providing readers with insights into its performance.

Conventional depth sensors often fail with transparent objects, resulting in incomplete or erroneous depth data.

To address these challenges, we propose TranSplat, a surface embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting method tailored for transparent objects. TranSplat uses a latent diffusion model to generate surface embeddings that provide consistent and continuous representations, making it robust to changes in viewpoint and lighting. By integrating these surface embeddings with input RGB images, TranSplat effectively captures the complexities of transparent surfaces, enhancing the splatting of 3D Gaussians and improving depth completion. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world transparent object benchmarks, as well as robot grasping tasks, show that TranSplat achieves accurate and dense depth completion, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications.

First, SIREN utilizes semantics to identify feature-rich regions of the local maps where the registration problem is better posed, eliminating the need for any initialization which is generally required in prior work. Second, SIREN identifies candidate correspondences between Gaussians in the local maps using robust semantic features, constituting the foundation for robust geometric optimization, coarsely aligning 3D Gaussian primitives extracted from the local maps. Third, this key step enables subsequent photometric refinement of the transformation between the submaps, where SIREN leverages novel-view synthesis in GSplat maps along with a semantics-based image filter to compute a high-accuracy non-rigid transformation for the generation of a high-fidelity fused map. We demonstrate the superior performance of SIREN compared to competing baselines across a range of real-world datasets, and in particular, across the most widely-used robot hardware platforms, including a manipulator, drone, and quadruped. In our experiments, SIREN achieves about 90x smaller rotation errors, 300x smaller translation errors, and 44x smaller scale errors in the most challenging scenes, where competing methods struggle. We will release the code and provide a link to the project page after the review process.",

This study explores its potential for the reconstruction of isotropic resolution 3D MRI from undersampled k-space data. We introduce a novel framework termed 3D Gaussian MRI (3DGSMR), which employs 3D Gaussian distributions as an explicit representation for MR volumes. Experimental evaluations indicate that this method can effectively reconstruct voxelized MR images, achieving a quality on par with that of well-established 3D MRI reconstruction techniques found in the literature. Notably, the 3DGSMR scheme operates under a self-supervised framework, obviating the need for extensive training datasets or prior model training.

While this can be achieved by building distance fields from range sensors and radiance fields from cameras, realising scalable incremental mapping of both fields consistently and at the same time with high quality is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel map representation that unifies a continuous signed distance field and a Gaussian splatting radiance field within an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map. By enforcing geometric consistency between these fields, we achieve mutual improvements by exploiting both modalities. We present a novel LiDAR-visual SLAM system called PINGS using the proposed map representation and evaluate it on several challenging large-scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PINGS can incrementally build globally consistent distance and radiance fields encoded with a compact set of neural points. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PINGS achieves superior photometric and geometric rendering at novel views by constraining the radiance field with the distance field. Furthermore, by utilizing dense photometric cues and multi-view consistency from the radiance field, PINGS produces more accurate distance fields, leading to improved odometry estimation and mesh reconstruction. We also provide an open-source implementation of PING at: https://github.com/PRBonn/PINGS.",

However, validating the deep pose estimation scheme in an actual ocean environment poses significant challenges due to the limited availability of research vessels and the associated operational costs. To address these issues, we present a photo-realistic 3D virtual environment leveraging recent advancements in Gaussian splatting, a novel technique that represents 3D scenes by modeling image pixels as Gaussian distributions in 3D space, creating a lightweight and high-quality visual model from multiple viewpoints. This approach enables the creation of a virtual environment integrating multiple real-world images collected in situ. The resulting simulation enables the indoor testing of flight maneuvers while verifying all aspects of flight software, hardware, and the deep monocular pose estimation scheme.

Recent advances in 3D occupancy prediction have improved scene representation but often suffer from visual inconsistencies, leading to floating artifacts and poor surface localization. Existing voxel-wise losses (e.g., cross-entropy) fail to enforce visible geometric coherence. In this paper, we propose GaussRender, a module that improves 3D occupancy learning by enforcing projective consistency. Our key idea is to project both predicted and ground-truth 3D occupancy into 2D camera views, where we apply supervision. Our method penalizes 3D configurations that produce inconsistent 2D projections, thereby enforcing a more coherent 3D structure. To achieve this efficiently, we leverage differentiable rendering with Gaussian splatting. GaussRender seamlessly integrates with existing architectures while maintaining efficiency and requiring no inference-time modifications. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks (SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, SSCBench-KITTI360) demonstrate that GaussRender significantly improves geometric fidelity across various 3D occupancy models (TPVFormer, SurroundOcc, Symphonies), achieving state-of-the-art results, particularly on surface-sensitive metrics such as RayIoU.

However, the images rendered by these methods are often plagued by blurring, undermining their reliability as training data for camera pose estimation. This limitation is particularly critical for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which aim at pixel-level 3D coordinate estimation, because rendering artifacts directly lead to estimation inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-criteria filtering mechanism that dynamically identifies and discards suboptimal pixels during training. The dual-criteria filter evaluates two concurrent metrics: (1) real-time SCR reprojection error, and (2) gradient threshold, across the coordinate regression domain. In addition, for visual localization problems in sparse input scenarios, it will be even more necessary to use data generated by NVS to assist the localization task. We design a coarse-to-fine PoI variant using sparse input NVS to solve this problem. Experiments across indoor and outdoor benchmarks confirm our method's efficacy. It achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.",

However, achieving this using a single imaging modality remains challenging. For instance, traditional RGB cameras suffer from low frame rates, limited exposure times, and narrow baselines. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion approach using Gaussian splatting, which combines RGB, depth, and event cameras to capture and reconstruct deforming scenes at high speeds. The key insight of our method lies in leveraging the complementary strengths of these imaging modalities: RGB cameras capture detailed color information, event cameras record rapid scene changes with microsecond resolution, and depth cameras provide 3D scene geometry. To unify the underlying scene representation across these modalities, we represent the scene using deformable 3D Gaussians. To handle rapid scene movements, we jointly optimize the 3D Gaussian parameters and their temporal deformation fields by integrating data from all three sensor modalities. This fusion enables efficient, high-quality imaging of fast and complex scenes, even under challenging conditions such as low light, narrow baselines, or rapid motion. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets captured with our prototype sensor fusion setup demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving noticeable improvements in both rendering fidelity and structural accuracy.",

To address these problems, we propose GARAD-SLAM, a real-time 3DGS-based SLAM system tailored for dynamic scenes. In terms of tracking, unlike traditional methods, we directly perform dynamic segmentation on Gaussians and map them back to the front-end to obtain dynamic point labels through a Gaussian pyramid network, achieving precise dynamic removal and robust tracking. For mapping, we impose rendering penalties on dynamically labeled Gaussians, which are updated through the network, to avoid irreversible erroneous removal caused by simple pruning.

However, existing methods face fundamental limitations: (i) difficulty capturing complex relationships between multiple objects described in the text, (ii) inability to generate physically plausible scene layouts, and (iii) lack of controllability and extensibility in compositional scenes. In this paper, we introduce LayoutDreamer, a framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to facilitate high-quality, physically consistent compositional scene generation guided by text. Specifically, given a text prompt, we convert it into a directed scene graph and adaptively adjust the density and layout of the initial compositional 3D Gaussians. Subsequently, dynamic camera adjustments are made based on the training focal point to ensure entity-level generation quality. Finally, by extracting directed dependencies from the scene graph, we tailor physical and layout energy to ensure both realism and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LayoutDreamer outperforms other compositional scene generation quality and semantic alignment methods. Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the multiple objects generation metric of T3Bench.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated superior quality in modeling 3D objects and scenes. However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.",

State-of-the-art neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods achieve high-fidelity RF data synthesis but are limited by long training times and high inference latency. We introduce GSRF, a framework that extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from the optical domain to the RF domain, enabling efficient RF data synthesis. GSRF realizes this adaptation through three key innovations: First, it introduces complex-valued 3D Gaussians with a hybrid Fourier-Legendre basis to model directional and phase-dependent radiance. Second, it employs orthographic splatting for efficient ray-Gaussian intersection identification. Third, it incorporates a complex-valued ray tracing algorithm, executed on RF-customized CUDA kernels and grounded in wavefront propagation principles, to synthesize RF data in real time. Evaluated across various RF technologies, GSRF preserves high-fidelity RF data synthesis while achieving significant improvements in training efficiency, shorter training time, and reduced inference latency.",

This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive \"digital twin\" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task.

Recently, this has led to the popularization of splatting methods, which eschew the traditional ray-based rendering of radiance fields in favor of rasterization. This has yielded a significant improvement in rendering speeds due to the efficiency of rasterization algorithms and hardware, but has come at a cost: the approximations that make rasterization efficient also make implementation of light transport phenomena like reflection and refraction much more difficult. We propose a novel scene representation which avoids these approximations, but keeps the efficiency and reconstruction quality of splatting by leveraging a decades-old efficient volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm which has been largely overlooked in recent computer vision research. The resulting model, which we name Radiant Foam, achieves rendering speed and quality comparable to Gaussian Splatting, without the constraints of rasterization. Unlike ray traced Gaussian models that use hardware ray tracing acceleration, our method requires no special hardware or APIs beyond the standard features of a programmable GPU.",

To address this issue, we propose a lip-aligned emotional face generator and leverage it to train our EmoTalkingGaussian model. It is able to manipulate facial emotions conditioned on continuous emotion values (i.e., valence and arousal); while retaining synchronization of lip movements with input audio. Additionally, to achieve the accurate lip synchronization for in-the-wild audio, we introduce a self-supervised learning method that leverages a text-to-speech network and a visual-audio synchronization network. We experiment our EmoTalkingGaussian on publicly available videos and have obtained better results than state-of-the-arts in terms of image quality (measured in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), emotion expression (measured in V-RMSE, A-RMSE, V-SA, A-SA, Emotion Accuracy), and lip synchronization (measured in LMD, Sync-E, Sync-C), respectively.",

Our 3D instance segmentation method directly lifts 2D segmentation masks from SAM (alternately FastSAM, etc.), together with features from CLIP and DINOv2, directly fusing them onto 3DGS (or similar Gaussian radiance fields such as 2DGS). Unlike previous approaches, LBG requires no per-scene training, allowing it to operate seamlessly on any existing 3DGS reconstruction. Our approach is not only an order of magnitude faster and simpler than existing approaches; it is also highly modular, enabling 3D semantic segmentation of existing 3DGS fields without requiring a specific parametrization of the 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, our technique achieves superior semantic segmentation for 2D semantic novel view synthesis and 3D asset extraction results while maintaining flexibility and efficiency. We further introduce a novel approach to evaluate individually segmented 3D assets from 3D radiance field segmentation methods.",

Simply incorporating SLAM and 3DGS leads to mismatches between the reconstructed frames.

Endo-2DTAM incorporates a surface normal-aware pipeline, which consists of tracking, mapping, and bundle adjustment modules for geometrically accurate reconstruction. Our robust tracking module combines point-to-point and point-to-plane distance metrics, while the mapping module utilizes normal consistency and depth distortion to enhance surface reconstruction quality. We also introduce a pose-consistent strategy for efficient and geometrically coherent keyframe sampling. Extensive experiments on public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that Endo-2DTAM achieves an RMSE of $1.87\\pm 0.63$ mm for depth reconstruction of surgical scenes while maintaining computationally efficient tracking, high-quality visual appearance, and real-time rendering.

Distinct from existing articulated neural rendering techniques, we introduce a differentiable process for spatial transformations based on 3D key points. This process supports deformations from the canonical template to a mesh with arbitrary bone lengths and poses. Additionally, we propose a real-time shadow simulation method based on per-pixel depth to simulate self-occlusion shadows caused by finger movements. Finally, we embed the hand prior and propose an animatable 3DGS representation of the hand driven solely by 3D key points. We validate the effectiveness of each component of our approach through comprehensive ablation studies. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that JGHand achieves real-time rendering speeds with enhanced quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.",

Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

In classical computer graphics, materials can be classified as diffuse or specular, interacting with light differently. The standard 3D Gaussian Splatting model struggles to represent view-dependent content, since it cannot differentiate an object within the scene from the light interacting with its specular surfaces, which produce highlights or reflections. In this paper, we propose to extend the 3D Gaussian Splatting model by introducing an additional symmetric matrix to enhance the opacity representation of each 3D Gaussian. This improvement allows certain Gaussians to be suppressed based on the viewer's perspective, resulting in a more accurate representation of view-dependent reflections and specular highlights without compromising the scene's integrity. By allowing the opacity to be view dependent, our enhanced model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Mip-Nerf, Tanks&Temples, Deep Blending, and Nerf-Synthetic datasets without a significant loss in rendering speed, achieving >60FPS, and only incurring a minimal increase in memory used.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach for 3D scene reconstruction using 3D Gaussians. However, neither the centers nor surfaces of the Gaussians are accurately aligned to the object surface, complicating their direct use in point cloud and mesh reconstruction. Additionally, 3DGS typically produces floater artifacts, increasing the number of Gaussians and storage requirements. To address these issues, we present FeatureGS, which incorporates an additional geometric loss term based on an eigenvalue-derived 3D shape feature into the optimization process of 3DGS. The goal is to improve geometric accuracy and enhance properties of planar surfaces with reduced structural entropy in local 3D neighborhoods.We present four alternative formulations for the geometric loss term based on 'planarity' of Gaussians, as well as 'planarity', 'omnivariance', and 'eigenentropy' of Gaussian neighborhoods. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluations on 15 scenes of the DTU benchmark dataset focusing on following key aspects: Geometric accuracy and artifact-reduction, measured by the Chamfer distance, and memory efficiency, evaluated by the total number of Gaussians. Additionally, rendering quality is monitored by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio. FeatureGS achieves a 30 % improvement in geometric accuracy, reduces the number of Gaussians by 90 %, and suppresses floater artifacts, while maintaining comparable photometric rendering quality. The geometric loss with 'planarity' from Gaussians provides the highest geometric accuracy, while 'omnivariance' in Gaussian neighborhoods reduces floater artifacts and number of Gaussians the most. This makes FeatureGS a strong method for geometrically accurate, artifact-reduced and memory-efficient 3D scene reconstruction, enabling the direct use of Gaussian centers for geometric representation.",

    "abstract": "3D object removal is an important sub-task in 3D scene editing, with broad applications in scene understanding, augmented reality, and robotics. However, existing methods struggle to achieve a desirable balance among consistency, usability, and computational efficiency in multi-view settings. These limitations are primarily due to unintuitive user interaction in the source view, inefficient multi-view object mask generation, computationally expensive inpainting procedures, and a lack of applicability across different radiance field representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline that improves the quality and efficiency of multi-view object mask generation and inpainting. Our method introduces an intuitive region-based interaction mechanism in the source view and eliminates the need for camera poses or extra model training. Our lightweight HoMM module is employed to achieve high-quality multi-view mask propagation with enhanced efficiency. In the inpainting stage, we further reduce computational costs by performing inpainting only on selected key views and propagating the results to other views via homography-based mapping. Our pipeline is compatible with a variety of radiance field frameworks, including NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, demonstrating improved generalizability and practicality in real-world scenarios. Additionally, we present a new 3D multi-object removal dataset with greater object diversity and viewpoint variation than existing datasets. Experiments on public benchmarks and our proposed dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing runtime to one-fifth of that required by leading baselines.",

In this paper, we present a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) experiment that aims to determine the perceived quality of 3D Gaussian avatars. Three factors were explored: Motion, LOD (i.e., #Gaussians), and the avatar height in Pixels (corresponding to the viewing distance). Participants viewed pairs of animated 3D Gaussian avatars and were tasked with choosing the most detailed one.

We introduce DiffSplat, a novel 3D generative framework that natively generates 3D Gaussian splats by taming large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. It differs from previous 3D generative models by effectively utilizing web-scale 2D priors while maintaining 3D consistency in a unified model. To bootstrap the training, a lightweight reconstruction model is proposed to instantly produce multi-view Gaussian splat grids for scalable dataset curation. In conjunction with the regular diffusion loss on these grids, a 3D rendering loss is introduced to facilitate 3D coherence across arbitrary views. The compatibility with image diffusion models enables seamless adaptions of numerous techniques for image generation to the 3D realm. Extensive experiments reveal the superiority of DiffSplat in text- and image-conditioned generation tasks and downstream applications. Thorough ablation studies validate the efficacy of each critical design choice and provide insights into the underlying mechanism.",

However, its reliance on Gaussian kernels for geometry and low-order Spherical Harmonics (SH) for color encoding limits its ability to capture complex geometries and diverse colors. We introduce Deformable Beta Splatting (DBS), a deformable and compact approach that enhances both geometry and color representation. DBS replaces Gaussian kernels with deformable Beta Kernels, which offer bounded support and adaptive frequency control to capture fine geometric details with higher fidelity while achieving better memory efficiency. In addition, we extended the Beta Kernel to color encoding, which facilitates improved representation of diffuse and specular components, yielding superior results compared to SH-based methods. Furthermore, Unlike prior densification techniques that depend on Gaussian properties, we mathematically prove that adjusting regularized opacity alone ensures distribution-preserved Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), independent of the splatting kernel type. Experimental results demonstrate that DBS achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while utilizing only 45% of the parameters and rendering 1.5x faster than 3DGS-MCMC, highlighting the superior performance of DBS for real-time radiance field rendering.

To this end, existing approaches utilize vector quantization (VQ) to project pixels onto a discrete codebook and reconstruct images from the discrete representation. However, compared with the continuous latent space, the limited discrete codebook space significantly restrict the representational ability of these image tokenizers. In this paper, we propose GaussianToken: An Effective Image Tokenizer with 2D Gaussian Splatting as a solution. We first represent the encoded samples as multiple flexible featured 2D Gaussians characterized by positions, rotation angles, scaling factors, and feature coefficients. We adopt the standard quantization for the Gaussian features and then concatenate the quantization results with the other intrinsic Gaussian parameters before the corresponding splatting operation and the subsequent decoding module. In general, GaussianToken integrates the local influence of 2D Gaussian distribution into the discrete space and thus enhances the representation capability of the image tokenizer. Competitive reconstruction performances on CIFAR, Mini-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

In this paper, we propose Rob-GS, a robust framework to progressively estimate camera poses and optimize 3DGS for arbitrarily long video inputs. In particular, by leveraging the inherent continuity of videos, we design an adjacent pose tracking method to ensure stable pose estimation between consecutive frames. To handle arbitrarily long inputs, we propose a Gaussian visibility retention check strategy to adaptively split the video sequence into several segments and optimize them separately.
